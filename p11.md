Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

In this problem I receive a collection of n integers. These numbers represent the height of vertical columns. I need to determine two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that contains the largest volume of water. I am required to return the maximum amount of water that the container I set can hold.

For `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`
`max_area = 49`
To determine the maximum volume of water it is necessary to calculate the maximum surface area between the best vertical lines.
I will calculate the minimum height between two bars of the string of bars and the distance on the OX axis between the legs of the two bars. By multiplying the two determinations I will find the current area.
Until the end, I have to return the maximum area that I can get through this algorithm.


A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:
1. Initializing the variables
2. Calculating the area
3. Return the final answer

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Initializing the variables:

```cpp
    int left = 0; 
    int right = height.size() - 1;
    int max_area = 0; 
```

In the initialization part, I need two counters `left` and `right`: `left` initialized on the leftmost position of the vector, `right` initialized on the rightmost position of the vector. The maximum area is initially `0`.

2. Calculating the area:

```cpp
        while (left < right) {
            // Calculate the area with the current pair of lines
            int current_height = min(height[left], height[right]);
            int current_width = right - left;
            int current_area = current_height * current_width;

            // Update the maximum area found so far
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area);

            // Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
```

The main loop traverses the vector from both ends toward the center. At each iteration of the loop, if I haven't reached the center of the vector (`left<right`), I calculate 3 distinct variables:
--- the variable `current_height` which will hold the minimum of the heights of the bars on the `left` and `right` positions. For this I use the `min(var1, var2)` function from `<algorithm>`.
--- the `current_width` variable that will indicate the current length on the OX axis between the 2 bars located on the `left` and `right` positions at each iteration of the loop.
--- the `current_area` variable which will determine the current area for the current height and the current length in each iteration of the loop.

For `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`
STEP1:
`right = 8, left = 0`
`current_height = min(height[left], height[right]) = min(1,7)=1;`
`current_width = right - left = 8-0 = 8;`
`current_area = current_height * current_width = 8*1=8;`
`left = 1`

If the height of the bar from the `left` position is lower than the height of the bar from the `right` position, adjust `left`, otherwise decrement `right`.
For the continuous update of the maximum area, I will use the `max(var1, var2)` function from `<algorithm>`.

3. Return the final answer:

The final result that I have to return is the very value of the maximum area which I calculated using this algorithm.

```cpp
        return max_area;
```

In conclusion, the main idea that I pursued throughout the implementation of this algorithm was to maximize the area by moving the indicators to explore all possibilities in linear time.
The algorithm ensures that I find the largest possible area between two lines by dynamically adjusting the two sides that form the container.
