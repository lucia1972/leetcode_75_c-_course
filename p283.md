Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

In this problem, I have a vector of numbers `nums` that contains non-zero elements and zeros. I have to rearrange the vector so that at the beginning there are only non-zero elements, in the initial order of the array, and then at the end there are all zero values.

The solution I propose is to go through the vector of numbers, to determine how many non-zero values I have, to place them in the vector in the right positions, and at the end to complete the vector with zero values until I reach the limit given by the initial length of the vector `nums.size `.

A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:
1. Initialization of variables
2. Traversal of the vector `nums` and determining the number of non-zero values
3. Complete the vector with zero values 

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Initialization of variables:

```cpp    
    int nonZero = 0;   
    }
```

I need the variable `nonZero` to count how many non-zero values the initial vector contains. This variable is of integer type and is initialized to 0.

2. Traversal of the vector `nums` and determining the number of non-zero values:

```cpp
   for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
        if (nums[i] != 0) {
            nums[nonZero] = nums[i];
            nonZero++;
        }
    }     
```

I go through the vector from one end to the other, that is, from 0 to `nums.size()`. Using the function `size()` it is extremely simple to determine the length of the vector.
If I find a non-zero value, I place it in the position given by the value of the variable `nonZero` and increment this variable by one to be able to put the new non-zero value on the next iteration if it is found. If they do not find a non-zero value, the `nonZero` variable is not incremented.

3. Complete the vector with zero values :

```cpp    
    for (int i = nonZero; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        nums[i] = 0;
    }
   
```
Starting from the value with which the variable `nonZero` leaves the first `for` loop, I enter the second `for` loop and fill the vector `nums` with values of `0` until I reach the final limit `nums.size()` .

For `nums = [0,4,5,0,8,0,7,9,0]`
`nums.size() = 9`
When the algorithm leaves the first `for` loop:
`nums = [4,5,8,7,9]`
`nonZero = 5`
So starting from position 5 to position 9 I have to fill the `nums` vector with zeros.
`nums = [4,5,8,7,9,0,0,0,0]`

In conclusion, this algorithm efficiently rearranges the elements of the vector nums such that all non-zero elements are moved to the beginning while maintaining their relative order, followed by all zero elements.
