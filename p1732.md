Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

A cyclist goes on a trip. The trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes. The cyclist starts the trip from the point `0` with the altitude equal to `0`.

You are given a vector of integers gain of length `n` where `gain[i]` represents the net elevation gain between points `i` and `i + 1` for all (0 <= i < n). You must return the highest altitude reached during the trip.

The cyclist starts from point `0` with altitude `0` and there are `n + 1` points in total.
The `gain` vector has `n` elements. Each `gain[i]` element represents the net elevation gain between points `i` and `i + 1`.
At each step, the new altitude is calculated by adding the corresponding value from the gain to the current altitude.
I must keep track of the maximum altitude reached during the hike.

For: `gain = [-5, 1, 5, 0, -7]`:

The initial point (point `0`) has elevation `0`.
Point `1`: `altitude 0 + (-5) = -5`
Point `2`: `altitude -5 + 1 = -4`
Point `3`: `altitude -4 + 5 = 1`
Point `4`: `altitude 1 + 0 = 1`
Point `5`: `altitude 1 + (-7) = -6`
The highest altitude reached is `1`.

So, I must traverse the gain vector, calculate the altitude at each point, and return the highest altitude reached during the trip.


A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:
1. Initializing the variables.
2. Traversal of the vector and calculate the altitude.
3. Return the maximum altitude.

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1.Initializing the variables:
```cpp
    int maxim=0;    
    signed int alt=0;
```
I need two variables in this algorithm:
--- `maxim` variable which calculate the maximum altitude;
--- `alt` variable represented the cyclist's current altitude during the trip. Starting at altitude `0`, we will update this variable as we traverse the gain vector to reflect the altitude at each point along the route.

2. Traversal of the vector and calculate the altitude:

```cpp
    for(int i=0;i<gain.size();i++){
        alt += gain[i];
        if(alt > maxim){
            maxim = alt;
        }
    }

```

Traversal of the vector is done using a `for` loop.
The vector is fully swept from `0` to `gain.size()`. We use the function `size()` to quickly determine the length of the vector.
At each iteration of the loop, I update the height dimension retained in `alt`. This represents the net change in elevation between points `i` and `i + 1`.
If the current alt altitude is greater than `maxim` (which stores the highest altitude encountered so far), then `maxim` is updated to reflect the new highest altitude reached.

3. Return the maximum altitude:
```cpp
    return maxim;
```
The `highestAltitude` function returns the `maximum` value, which is the highest altitude reached during the trip.

The algorithm simply loops through the `gain` vector and accumulates the altitude changes in `alt` while keeping the highest altitude value reached in the `maxim`.
The code written this way uses a simple traversal algorithm to calculate the current altitude at each step and store the highest altitude reached. This is a linear and efficient approach.
