```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
    
        vector<int> answer(nums.size(), 1);
        int i, product1=1, product2=1;

        // I calculate the product of the elements before the current element
        for (i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            answer[i] = product1;
            product1 *= nums[i];
        }
        
        // Calculation of the product of all elements after the current element
        //and we make the product with the previously calculated values
        for (i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            answer[i] *= product2;
            product2 *= nums[i];
        }
        
        return answer;
}
};
```

In this problem, I get an array, `nums`. I have to return an array called `answer`.
When I go over the array, I have to calculate the product of every element in the array without the element on position `nums[i]` where I currently am, and store that product on `answer[i]`.
*desen* - For example, if I have `nums[a,b,c,d]` then `answer` will be `answer[bcd, acd, abd, abc]`.

The most intuitive approach would be to calculate the product of all the values in the array, then divide that final product with each value on `nums[i]` and store my dividend on `answer[i]`. But, the problem specifies that I cannot use division in my solution.
Also, it's not guaranteed that the array contains only non-zero values. So there is a likely chance that I end up with division by 0 which isn't allowed.

To describe the algorithm's steps, I first initialized the variables, then I calculate the product of the elements before `nums[i]` and the product of the elements after `nums[i]`, and then I form my final answer by commbining the 2 calculated products and storing them on position `i` in `answer`.

So, let's discuss the proposed algorithm. First, I initialize the variables `answer`, `i`, `product1` and `product2`.
```cpp
    vector<int> answer(nums.size(), 1);
    int i, product1=1, product2=1; 
```
--- `answer` is an array of integer values, which I'll use to store my final results. But, in order to not encounter any issues during my multiplication process, I initalize `answer` on 1, because, as we all know, 1 is the neutral value to multiplication. Any multiplication of x by 1 results in x.

---`i` is a counter that I will use in the `for` loop to traverse the given array `nums`.

---`product1` is used to calculate the product of all the values before `nums[i]` 

---`product2` is used to calculate the produvt of all the values after `nums[i]`



2. I calculate the product of the elements before the current element:

```cpp
        for (i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            answer[i] = product1;
            product1 *= nums[i];
        }
```



In this loop, for each element in the `nums` vector, I store the value of `product1` in `answer[i]` and then update the value of `product1` by multiplying it by the value at position `i` in the `nums` vector , that is `nums[i]`.
The loop is repeated along the entire length of the `nums` vector. The length of the vector is determined using the `size()` function.

For `nums= [1,2,3,4]`
`answer = [1,1*1,1*2,1*2*3] = [1,1,2,6]`

3. I calculate the product of the elements after each current element:

```cpp
        for (i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            answer[i] *= product2;
            product2 *= nums[i];
        }
```

In this step of the algorithm, I enter the `answer` vector already containing the values of the products from step 2.
For each element, I multiply the existing value in `answer[i]` by `product2`, then update `product2` by multiplying it by `nums[i]`.
This time, it is necessary to go through the vector in the opposite direction.


For `nums= [1,2,3,4]` and `answer = [1,1,2,6]`
`answer = [1*24,1*12,2*4,6*1] = [24,12,8,6]`
step1 - `product2=4`
step2 - `product2=12`
step3 - `product2=24`
step4 - `product2=24`

The final result will therefore be retained, value by value, in the `answer` vector that the function will return at the end.
```cpp
        return answer;
```

In short, I calculated the product of all the elements of a vector of integers, except the current element, for each position in the vector, without using the division operation.
To avoid splitting and to respect the constraints of the problem, I calculated two separate products:
--- the product of the elements in front of each element (`product1`);
--- the product of the elements behind each element (`product2`).
The final values that were requested to be returned were obtained by combining the 2 calculated products.
