Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

In this problem, I have to choose from the numbers of an unsorted collection of numbers 2 numbers whose sum is equal to 
a given value `k`, and eliminate them. I repeat this operation as much as possible. At the end, I have to return the number 
of draws of 2 numbers whose sum is equal to `k`, which I managed to execute.

The solution method I propose to approach is to initially sort our vector and then use two variables `left` and `right` 
with which to traverse the vector from one end to the other and look for pairs of numbers that satisfy the condition of the problem.

A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:
1. Sort the number collection
2. Initialize the `left` and `right` variables
3. Traversal of the vector using the two variables
4. Return the numbers of pairs of numbers that we were able to remove from the vector.

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Sort the number collection:

```cpp
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
```

The initial sorting of the given vector is done quickly with the help of the function `sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());`. 
This function is part of the `<algorithm>` standard library.
--- `nums.begin()` represents an iterator that points to the beginning of the vector `nums`.
--- `nums.end()` represents an iterator that indicates the end of the `nums` vector.
Using this function, all elements in world `nums` vector, will be sorted in ascending order.

2. Initialize the `left` and `right` variables:
After sorting, I initialize two integer variables, one at the beginning `left=0` and one at the end `right = nums.size()-1` 
of the vector. This allows me to efficiently traverse the vector to find k-sum pairs.

```cpp
    int left = 0;           // Pointer to the beginning of the array
    int right = nums.size() - 1; // Pointer to the end of the array
    int operations = 0;     // Count of operations
```
Also interested in the outline for operations in the entire `operation` variable.

3. Traversal of the vector using the two variables:

```cpp
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
        if (sum == k) {
            // If the sum is equal to k, I found a valid pair
            operations++;
            left++;
            right--;
        } else if (sum < k) {
            // If the sum is less than k, move the left pointer to the right
            left++;
        } else {
            // If the sum is greater than k, move the right pointer to the left
            right--;
        }
    }
```
Using the 2 variables `left` and `right` I go through the entire vector coming from the ends to the center of the ascending sorted vector.
If the sum of the current pair is equal to `k`, count this pair and move both pointers to exclude the current pair. If the sum is less than 
`k`, move the pointer left to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than `k`, move the pointer right to decrease the sum. 
This allows the algorithm to operate in `O(n)` time.


4. Return the numbers of pairs of numbers that we were able to remove from the vector:

```cpp
return operations;
```
This is how the algorithm provides its final result, that is, the answer to the question: "How many pairs of numbers can be found in the vector so that their sum is equal to k?"

In conclusion, the algorithm uses initial sort and a two-pointer method to efficiently find pairs of numbers whose sum is equal to 
`k`. Thus, I return the maximum number of such pairs that can be removed from the vector.
