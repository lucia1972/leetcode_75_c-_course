Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

In this problem I have two strings `str1` and `str2` , and I will say that 'str1' divides `str2` ,only if, `str1` is formed 
by concatenation of itself with `str2` any number of times. Meaning if `str1 = str2+str2+...+str2`

I need to return the largest string `x` such that `x` divides both `str1` and `str2`. So I'll need to write a function that returns a string.

A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:

1. Cyclic concatenation check
2. GCD calculation of string lengths
3. Return the final answer

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Cyclic concatenation check:

In this first step, I check if the string concatenation is cyclic, meaning if `str1 + str2 == str2 + str1`. If this does 
not happen, I can directly return the empty string because there is no common string that can divide both strings.

```c++
if(str1 + str2 != str2 + str1) return "";
```
A string `x` is shared and divided into `str1` and `str2` only if the concatenation of the two strings in both directions 
is the same. This is based on the cyclic property of strings that can be formed by repeating a common substring.

### ***Cyclicity Property***
***The cyclicity property of strings refers to the fact that if a string can be formed by repeating a common substring, 
then all cyclic rotations of this string are equivalent. This idea can be extended to determine whether two strings have 
a common substring by checking the equality of concatenations in different directions.***


### Property Formulation
The string `x` divides both strings, i.e. both can be formed by repeating `x` if and only if: `str1 + str2 = str2+str1`.

This means that when I concatenate `str1` and `str2` in both possible ways, I get the same result. If this condition is 
met, it means that there is a string `x` which is the common base of both strings. 

For this operation, I didn't need to define any new variables.

2. GCD calculation of string lengths: 

In this step, I will use the `gcd(a,b)` function from the <numeric> library. This function in C++ returns the greatest common divisor of the 2 input parameters.

In the case of the problem I am discussing, I will need `gcd(long1, long2)` where `long1` and `long2` are the lengths of the 
2 strings `str1` and `str2`. To determine the length / size of a string I will use the `size()` method from the string class.

```c++
  int divide = gcd(str1.size(), str2.size());
```

This is a crucial step in determining the substring that repeats between the 2 strings.

The common substring must be of the length exactly given by the common divisor of the lengths of the 2 strings.

For example, for `str1 = "abc"` and `str2="abcabc"`, `str1.size()` is 3, because the string has 3 characters, and `str2.size()` is 6.`gcd (str1.size(), str2.size())` is 3.

Finally, I will get the value `divide`.

3. Return the final answer:

```cpp 
  return str1.substr(0,divide);
```

The final string response, which I will return will actually be the part of the string `str1` that starts from position 
0 and is of length `divide`, meaning the greatest common divisor between the lengths of the 2 initial strings.

For `str1=LEET` and `str2 = CODE`
`str1 + str2 = str2+str1` is `LEETCODE` = `CODELEET` FALSE
If this answer is FALSE, the final answer will be `""`

For `str1=ababab` and `str2 = abab`
`str1 + str2 = str2+str1` is `ababababab` = `ababababab` TRUE
If this answer is TRUE
Variable `divide = gcd(6, 4) = 4`

So, I return the substring of `str1` from position 0 to position 4, that is the string `abab` - this is the common substring. 
This is the final answer.

In conclusion, I created a function that checks for cyclic concatenation, that is, if strings are concatenated in both 
directions the answer is the same. If this conclusion is false then the final answer is `""`.
Then calculate the greatest common divisor of the lengths of the 2 strings because it will represent the length of the 
common substring. Finally, the common substring of a determined length will be cut / extracted from `str1', from position 0 to the already determined length.

See you in the next video.
