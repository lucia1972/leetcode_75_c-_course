Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

In this problem I have to place flowers in a flower bed so that the flowers are not adjacent.
For this I get an array `flowerbed` which contains only values of `0` and `1`:
--- `0` means empty place;
--- `1` means planted flower.
Also, as entry data, I have a number of flowers that should be planted `n` so that they are not adjacent.
For two flowers to not be adjacent the vector must contain three consecutive null values.

I have to return a boolean answer, namely true if I managed to plant the `n` flowers, or false otherwise.

A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:

1. Initializing the number of flowers planted
2. Traversal of the vector
3. Return the final answer

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Initializing the number of flowers planted:

In this first step, I will declare an integer variable `flower`, in which I will count the flowers I managed to plant. This variable is initialized to 0.

````c++
int flower=0;
````

2. Traversal of the vector:
I cycle through the `flowerbed` vector to check if I can plant a flower.
To loop through each position of the `flowerbed` vector, I use a repeating `for` structure.

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.size(); ++i) {


} 
```

The first position of the array is position `0` and the last is `flowerbed.size()-1`, where `flowerbed.size()` determines the length of the entire array.

Also in this step, we need to determine the value of the left position and the value of the right position for each iteration.

```c++
int left = (i == 0) ? 0 : flowerbed[i - 1];
```

I declared a new integer variable `left`.
If `i` is `0` (I am at the beginning of the vector), then `left` will be `0`. This simulates that there is no other element before the first element (so I can consider it "empty").
If `i` is not `0` (I am anywhere else in the vector), then `left` will be set to the value of the previous element in the vector, that is `flowerbed[i - 1]`.

This is a way to check if the previous place is empty or not without going outside the bounds of the vector, especially for the first element.

```c++
int right = (i == flowerbed.size() - 1) ? 0 : flowerbed[i + 1];
```

For the right end of the array, I declared a new integer variable `right`.
If I am at the last position (i == flowerbed.size() - 1), there is no position to the `right`, so I set `right` to `0`. 
Otherwise, `right` will be the value from the next position `(flowerbed[i + 1])`.

To check if I can plant a flower I will determine the value between the current position, the position to its left and 
the one to its right. If this amount is `0`, it means that positions adjacent to the current position are empty, so I 
an plant a flower in the current position.
If I can plant a flower, I will change the value of the current position from 0 to 1 and increase the value of the 
`flower' variable because I managed to plant a new flower.

So the repetitive `for' structure at the end has this form:

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.size(); ++i) {
           
            int left = (i == 0) ? 0 : flowerbed[i - 1];
      
            int right = (i == flowerbed.size() - 1) ? 0 : flowerbed[i + 1];
            
            if (left + flowerbed[i] + right == 0) {
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                
                flower++;
            }
        }

```


3. Return the final answer:

```cpp
return flower >= n;
```

Thus, I achieved an efficient and clear solution, iterating through the flowerbed only once and performing simple 
operations to determine if I can plant the number of flowers initially entered.
