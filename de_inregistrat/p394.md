In this problem, I am given an encoded string that needs to be decoded. The string contains segments in the format `number[string]`, where `string` is a sequence of characters that repeats in the final decoded string as many times as specified by `number`.

For example, given the input `s = 2[abc]3[cd]ef`, the decoding process works as follows:

The segment `2[abc]` translates to `abcabc` because the substring `abc` is repeated twice. Next, the segment `3[cd]` translates to `cdcdcd`, repeating `cd` three times. Finally, the remaining segment `ef` remains unchanged. When these parts are combined, the final decoded string is `abcabccdcdcdef`.

However, the problem can become more complex with nested brackets. For instance, given the input `s = 2[ab3[b4[rt]]x]`, the decoding process must start from the innermost brackets and work outward. First, the segment `4[rt]` translates to `rtrtrtrt`, which updates the string to `2[ab3[brtrtrtrt]x]`. Next, `3[brtrtrtrt]` translates to `brtrtrtrtbrtrtrtrtbrtrtrtrt`, further updating the string to `2[abbrtrtrtrtbrtrtrtrtbrtrtrtrtx]`. Finally, `2[abbrtrtrtrtbrtrtrtrtbrtrtrtrtx]` translates to `abbrtrtrtrtbrtrtrtrtbrtrtrtrtxabbrtrtrtrtbrtrtrtrtbrtrtrtrtx`.

To solve this problem efficiently, the key is to decode the string from the innermost brackets outward, starting with the most deeply nested segments. This is naturally suited to a stack-based approach, as stacks allow us to handle elements in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner, which aligns perfectly with the need to process nested structures from the inside out.

Hereâ€™s how the solution works:

First, I initialize two stacks: one to store numbers (`stackNumber`) and another to store partial strings (`stackResponse`). As I iterate through the input string `s`, I use temporary variables `currentNumber` and `currentStr` to build the number and string segments that need to be repeated.

When I encounter a digit in the string, I update `currentNumber` to construct the full number from individual digits. This is crucial for handling multi-digit numbers, such as converting `123` from characters into the integer 123.

When I encounter an opening bracket `[`, I push the current `currentNumber` and `currentStr` onto their respective stacks and then reset them. This prepares the stacks to handle the next segment of the string.

When a closing bracket `]` is encountered, it signifies the end of a segment that needs to be repeated. I then pop the last number and the last partial string from their stacks, repeat the current string segment accordingly, and append it to the previously stored string from the stack. This approach ensures that nested structures are properly decoded.

If a character is encountered that is not part of a compressed structure (i.e., it is outside any `number[string]` format), it is simply added to `currentStr`.

To illustrate this with the example `s = 2[abc]3[cd]ef`, the characters `ef` are processed at the end and added directly to the final result, since they do not belong to any bracketed segment.

The final decoded string is built by continuously processing characters and updating `currentStr` with the decoded segments. Once the entire string has been processed, `currentStr` holds the fully decoded string.

In conclusion, this problem involves decoding a string that contains compressed segments in the format `number[string]`, with possible nested structures. By using a stack-based approach, I efficiently manage the nested brackets and ensure that the string is decoded correctly from the innermost parts outward. Stacks are ideal for this task because they allow for easy backtracking and handling of nested elements. The final decoded string is constructed by processing each segment step-by-step, ensuring that all parts of the string are correctly expanded and combined.

Now, let's test the code to make sure it handles various cases correctly, especially those involving complex nested structures. Testing is essential to confirm that the implementation works as intended across different scenarios. Additionally, exploring alternative approaches and optimizations may lead to more efficient solutions, enhancing both problem-solving skills and understanding of the algorithm.
