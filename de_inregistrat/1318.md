In this problem, we are given three numbers: `a`, `b`, and `c`. The objective is to determine the minimum number of bit flips required to make the expression `a OR b == c` true. To clarify, the OR operation on two bits returns `1` if at least one of the corresponding bits is `1`. Therefore, our task is to go through the binary representations of the numbers and calculate how many flips are needed to meet this condition.

The key is to analyze each bit in the binary representation of `a`, `b`, and `c`. We start from the least significant bit (LSB) and move towards the more significant bits. At each position, we compare the corresponding bits of `a`, `b`, and `c` to decide whether we need to flip bits in `a` or `b` to satisfy the condition `a OR b == c`. This requires isolating each bit of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and handling the various cases that arise.

If the current bit of `c` is `0`, both the corresponding bits in `a` and `b` must also be `0`. If either of these bits is `1`, it must be flipped to `0`, and we increment the flip count for each necessary change. On the other hand, if the current bit of `c` is `1`, at least one of the corresponding bits in `a` or `b` must be `1`. If both bits are `0`, we need to flip one of them to `1` to make the expression true.

To break this down more clearly:

- For each bit in `c` that is `0`, if either `a` or `b` has a `1`, we flip it to `0` because `a OR b` must result in `0` for that bit.
- For each bit in `c` that is `1`, if both `a` and `b` have `0`, one of them must be flipped to `1` to satisfy the condition that `a OR b` equals `1`.

We follow this process for each bit, starting from the least significant one, and use the bitwise AND operation (`& 1`) to extract the current bit from each number. After processing each bit, we shift all three numbers (`a`, `b`, and `c`) one position to the right, allowing us to access the next bit for comparison.

This approach is efficient because the number of bits we are working with is limited—typically 32 or 64 bits depending on the system. The time complexity remains constant since we perform the same operation on each bit, and the space complexity is minimal as we only need a few variables to store temporary values during the process.

To better understand how this approach works, let’s consider a concrete example. Suppose a = 2, b = 6, and c = 5. In binary, a is represented as 010, b as 110, and c as 101. Starting with the least significant bits, the first bit of a is 0, the first bit of b is also 0, and the first bit of c is 1. Since both a and b are 0 in this position, but c is 1, one of the bits in a or b must be flipped to 1 to satisfy the condition a OR b == 1. Moving on to the next bit, the second bit of a is 1, the second bit of b is 1, and the second bit of c is 0. Here, both a and b need to be flipped to 0 because 1 OR 1 == 1, which doesn’t match 0 in c. Therefore, two flips are needed for this bit. Finally, the third bit of a is 0, the third bit of b is 1, and the third bit of c is 1. In this case, no flips are needed because 0 OR 1 == 1, which matches c. The total number of flips required for this example is three.

In summary, the solution iterates through each bit of `a`, `b`, and `c`, calculates how many bit flips are necessary, and accumulates this in a counter. Once all bits have been processed, the counter gives us the minimum number of flips required to satisfy the condition `a OR b == c`.

Let's now put this solution to the test to ensure it handles all potential edge cases. This will confirm its accuracy and overall reliability.
