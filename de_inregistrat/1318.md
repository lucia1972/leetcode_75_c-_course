In this problem, we are given three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`. The goal is to determine the minimum number of bit flips required to make the expression `a OR b == c` true.

The OR operation on bits returns `1` if at least one of the corresponding bits in `a` or `b` is `1`. Here's a quick recap of the OR operation:
- `0 OR 0 = 0`
- `0 OR 1 = 1`
- `1 OR 0 = 1`
- `1 OR 1 = 1`

A flip consists of changing a bit from `1` to `0` or from `0` to `1` in the binary representation of `a` or `b`.

To solve the problem, I will examine each bit of `a`, `b`, and `c` and determine what changes are needed to ensure that `a OR b == c`.

I will use a variable `flips` to count the number of bit flips needed. This will be the final value we return.

The key observations are:
1. If the current bit in `c` is `1`, at least one of the corresponding bits in `a` or `b` must be `1`.
2. If the current bit in `c` is `0`, both corresponding bits in `a` and `b` must be `0`. If either bit is `1`, it needs to be flipped to `0`.

I will iterate through each bit of `a`, `b`, and `c` as long as at least one of them is non-zero. The idea is to check each bit from right to left, comparing the corresponding bits in `a` and `b` with those in `c` to determine the number of flips needed.

To extract the current least significant bit (LSB) from each number, I will use the bitwise AND operation with `1`. This operation isolates the LSB of a number:
- `a & 1` will return `1` if the LSB of `a` is `1`, otherwise `0`.

For example, if `a = 6` (binary `0110`), `a & 1` results in `0`, which is the LSB of `a`.

The plan is to iterate through each bit, starting from the least significant one. I’ll check the combination of bits from `a`, `b`, and `c` and determine if a flip is necessary, then accumulate the number of required flips.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Check if the current bit in `c` is `0`:**

    ```cpp
    if (bitC == 0) {
    ```

    If `c`'s bit is `0`, then both `bitA` and `bitB` must be `0` as well to satisfy `a OR b == 0`. If either `bitA` or `bitB` is `1`, it needs to be flipped to `0`, and we increment the `flips` counter accordingly:

    ```cpp
    if (bitA == 1) flips++; // Flip `bitA` to `0`
    if (bitB == 1) flips++; // Flip `bitB` to `0`
    ```

2. **If the current bit in `c` is `1`:**

    ```cpp
    } else {
    ```

    To satisfy `a OR b == 1`, at least one of the bits `bitA` or `bitB` must be `1`. If both are `0`, a flip is needed to make one of them `1`:

    ```cpp
    if (bitA == 0 && bitB == 0) flips++; // Flip either `bitA` or `bitB` to `1`
    ```

3. **Shift the numbers right to process the next bit:**

    The `>>=` operator is used to shift all bits to the right by one position, making the next most significant bit the new LSB:

    ```cpp
    a >>= 1;
    b >>= 1;
    c >>= 1;
    ```

    This operation continues in a loop until all bits are processed.

By iterating through each bit and applying these rules, we can accurately count the number of flips needed.

This approach is efficient, with a time complexity of `O(1)`, as the number of bits is constant (typically 32 or 64 bits depending on the system). The space complexity is also `O(1)` since we only use a few extra variables.

Finally, this method ensures that all bits are checked and flipped as necessary to satisfy the condition `a OR b == c`, providing a correct and optimal solution to the problem.

To confirm the reliability and efficiency of the solution, it’s important to test it with various inputs, including edge cases such as when `a`, `b`, or `c` are `0`, or when they have large values. Testing will ensure that the algorithm works correctly in all scenarios, guaranteeing its robustness in solving the problem.
