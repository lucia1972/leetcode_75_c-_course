In this problem, we play a number guessing game.
I choose a number from 1 to `n'. You have to guess which number I chose.

Every time you make a mistake, I will tell you if the number you are looking for is higher or lower than the number you said.

You have at your disposal a predefined API `int guess(int num)', which returns three possible results:

--- -1 if your number is higher than the number I chose,
--- 1 if your number is lower than the number I chose and
--- 0 if your number is equal to the number I chose.

Returns the number I chose.

For `n = 10` and `pick = 6` I will return 6.

I will approach the problem based on the binary search algorithm. This algorithm is suitable because it allows us to halve the search space with each guess, based on feedback from the `guess' function.

Binary search is an efficient algorithm used to find an element in an ordered list. By repeatedly dividing the search range in half, the algorithm can substantially reduce the number of comparisons required to find an element.


I will initialize two variables `low` and `high` to represent the current guessing range. Initially, `low' is `1' and `high' is `n', meaning the range is full.

Calculate the middle value of the current range:

`mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.

I call the function `guess(mid)' to check if `mid' is the chosen number.
I have three possible answers to this function call: `-1`, `1` or `0`. Each must be treated accordingly.

If `guess(mid)` returns `0`, we found the number and return it.

If `guess(mid)` returns `-1`, it means the number chosen is less than `mid`, so we adjust the search range by setting `high = mid - 1`. This means that all values ​​greater than or equal to `mid' are removed from the search range.

If `guess(mid)` returns `1`, it means that the number chosen is greater than `mid`, so we adjust the search range by setting `low = mid + 1`.

For example, for `n = 100` and `pick = 30` I will have `low = 1`, `high = 100`, I will calculate `mid = (1 + 100) / 2 = 50` and I will call `guess( 50)` which will respond with `-1`, so all numbers greater than 50 must be removed because the number I'm looking for (`pick = 30`) is definitely not in the range `[50, 100]`. So the new `high' limit will become `mid - 1 = 49'.
The new search will be done in the range `[1, 49]'.

Still `low <=high', so the `while' loop repeats.
The new middle value `mid = (1 + 49) / 2 = 25' is calculated and I will call `guess(25)' which will answer with `1', so all numbers smaller than 25 must be removed because the number sought by mine (`pick = 30`) is definitely not in the range `[1, 25]`. So the new low limit will become mid + 1 = 26.
The new search will be done in the interval `[26, 49]`.

Still `low <=high', so the `while' loop repeats.
The new middle value `mid = (26 + 49) / 2 = 37` is calculated and I will call `guess(37)` which will answer with `-1`, so all numbers greater than 37 must be removed because the number sought by me (`pick = 30`) is definitely not found in the range `[37, 49]`. So the new `high' limit will become `mid - 1 = 36'. The new search will be done in the range `[26, 36]'.

Still `low <=high', so the `while' loop repeats.
The new middle value `mid = (26 + 36) / 2 = 31' is calculated and I will call `guess(31)' which will answer with `-1', so all numbers greater than 31 must be removed because the number sought by me (`pick = 30`) is definitely not found in the range `[31, 36]`. So the new `high' limit will become `mid - 1 = 30'.
The new search will be done in the interval `[26, 30]`.

Still `low <=high', so the `while' loop repeats.
The new middle value `mid = (26 + 30) / 2 = 28' is calculated and I will call `guess(28)' which will answer with `1', so all numbers smaller than 28 must be removed because the number sought by mine (`pick = 30`) is definitely not in the range `[26, 28]`. So the new low limit will become mid + 1 = 29.
The new search will be done in the interval `[29, 30]`.

Still `low <=high', so the `while' loop repeats.
The new middle value `mid = (29 + 30) / 2 = 29' is calculated and I will call `guess(29)' which will answer with `1', so all numbers smaller than 29 must be removed because the number sought by mine (`pick = 30`) is definitely not in the range `[28, 29]`. So the new low limit will become mid + 1 = 30.
The new search will be done in the range `[30, 30]'.

Last check - `low <=high' are even equal this time, so the loop is executed one more time.
The new middle value `mid = (30 + 30) / 2 = 30' is calculated and I will call `guess(30)' which will answer with `0'.
If the answer received is `0', I will directly return the previously calculated `mid' value and the algorithm stops.

```cpp
    if (res == 0) {
        return mid;
```

in the end,

`return -1; // In case there is no valid answer, although the problem guarantees there is one.`

is needed to be added to ensure that the function returns a value in all cases, although the problem guarantees that there will always be a valid answer. It is good programming practice to ensure that our function returns a value even in unexpected cases. This can help prevent unexpected behavior or runtime errors in our code.

The function is defined to return an `int'. If we reach the end of the function without returning a value, the compiler will throw an error. Returning a default value such as `-1` ensures compliance with the function's return type.

In summary, this problem asks us to guess a number between `1` and `n` using an API that tells us if our number is too big, too small, or right. We used a binary search algorithm to streamline the guessing process, cutting the search interval in half with each guess. We initialized the search range with `low` and `high`, and adjusted these limits based on feedback from the `guess` API. If the API indicates that our guess is correct, we return the number.

The final line `return -1` is included as a safety measure to ensure that the function returns a valid value in all cases, even though the problem guarantees that there is always a valid answer.

Now, let's test this code to confirm it operates correctly. Feel free to try different scenarios, including edge cases, and consider alternative implementations. This process not only validates the solution but also deepens your understanding and enhances your problem-solving skills.
