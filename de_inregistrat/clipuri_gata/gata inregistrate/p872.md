The task here is to determine if two binary trees are "leaf-similar," meaning their sequences of leaf values must be identical. The sequence of values from the leaves of a binary tree is determined by traversing the leaves from left to right. The function required for this task accepts two binary trees (`root1` and `root2`) and returns `true` if and only if the sequences of their leaf values match.

To solve this, we start by declaring two vectors, `leaves1` and `leaves2`, which will store the leaf values of the two trees respectively. The `collectLeaves` function is called on `root1` to gather its leaf values into `leaves1`. Similarly, the `collectLeaves` function is invoked on `root2` to populate `leaves2`. Finally, we compare the two leaf vectors with the expression `return leaves1 == leaves2;`, returning `true` if they are identical, and `false` otherwise.

The `collectLeaves` function is designed to traverse the binary tree and collect the leaf values. Since it is a `void` function, it does not return any value but instead modifies the `leaves` vector passed to it. If the `node` is `nullptr`, the function terminates early because this indicates that the tree is empty or we have reached the end of a branch. If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has no left or right children), its value is added to the `leaves` vector. This step is crucial for gathering the leaf values from the binary tree.

If the current node has a left child, the function recursively calls `collectLeaves` on the left subtree. This ensures that the function continues to explore the tree down the left side until all leaves are reached, adding each leaf value encountered to the `leaves` vector. Similarly, if the current node has a right child, the function calls `collectLeaves` on the right subtree. This means the function will continue down the right side of the tree until all leaves are found, adding these values to the `leaves` vector.

Here's a simple example to illustrate:

Consider two binary trees. Tree 1 has leaf nodes with values [4, 5, 6], and Tree 2 also has leaf nodes with values [4, 5, 6]. When `collectLeaves` is called on both trees, it gathers these leaf values into `leaves1` and `leaves2`. Since both vectors contain [4, 5, 6], the function will return `true`, indicating the trees are leaf-similar.

In conclusion, the `collectLeaves` function works by recursively traversing the tree, identifying leaves, and adding their values to the `leaves` vector. The check for whether a node is a leaf is done using the condition `!node->left && !node->right`. If this condition is met, the node's value is added to the `leaves` vector. After collecting the leaves for both trees, the two vectors are compared to determine if the trees are "leaf-similar." This method is both efficient and straightforward, ensuring that each node is visited only once, resulting in an `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the total number of nodes in each tree.

Let's give this algorithm a test to ensure it functions properly. Experimenting with different tree configurations will help verify its reliability and versatility.
