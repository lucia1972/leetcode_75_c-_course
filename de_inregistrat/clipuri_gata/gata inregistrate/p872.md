The task here is to determine if two binary trees are "leaf-similar," meaning their sequences of leaf values must be identical. The sequence of values from the leaves of a binary tree is determined by traversing the leaves from left to right. The function required for this task accepts two binary trees (`root1` and `root2`) and returns `true` if and only if the sequences of their leaf values match.

To solve this, I start by declaring two vectors, `leaves1` and `leaves2`, which will store the leaf values of the two trees respectively. The `collectLeaves` function is called on `root1` to gather its leaf values into `leaves1`. Similarly, the `collectLeaves` function is invoked on `root2` to populate `leaves2`. Finally, I compare the two leaf vectors with the expression `return leaves1 == leaves2;`, returning `true` if they are identical, and `false` otherwise.

The `collectLeaves` function is designed to traverse the binary tree and collect the leaf values. Since it is a `void` function, it does not return any value but instead modifies the `leaves` vector passed to it. If the `node` is `nullptr`, the function terminates early because this indicates that the tree is empty or we have reached the end of a branch. If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has no left or right children), its value is added to the `leaves` vector. This step is crucial for gathering the leaf values from the binary tree.

If the current node has a left child, the function recursively calls `collectLeaves` on the left subtree with `collectLeaves(node->left, leaves)`. This ensures that the function continues to explore the tree down the left side until all leaves are reached, adding each leaf value encountered to the `leaves` vector. Similarly, if the current node has a right child, the function calls `collectLeaves` on the right subtree with `collectLeaves(node->right, leaves)`. This means the function will continue down the right side of the tree until all leaves are found, adding these values to the `leaves` vector.

In conclusion, the `collectLeaves` function works by recursively traversing the tree, identifying leaves, and adding their values to the `leaves` vector. The check for whether a node is a leaf is done using the condition `!node->left && !node->right`. If this condition is met, the node's value is added to the `leaves` vector. After collecting the leaves for both trees, the two vectors are compared to determine if the trees are "leaf-similar." This method is both efficient and straightforward, ensuring that each node is visited only once, resulting in an `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the total number of nodes in each tree.

The sequence of values of the leaves of a binary tree is given by traversing the leaves from left to right. The problem asks me to determine if two binary trees are `leaf-similar`, i.e., if their leaf value sequences are identical. The function I need to write takes two binary trees (`root1` and `root2`) and returns `true` if and only if their sequences of leaf values are identical.

I declare two vectors `leaves1` and `leaves2` to store the values of the leaves of the two trees. I call the `collectLeaves` function on `root1` and store the result in `leaves1`. I call the `collectLeaves` function on `root2` and store the result in `leaves2`. Compare the two leaf vectors `return leaves1 == leaves2;` and return `true` if they are equal, or `false` otherwise.

In the `collectLeaves` function, which is a `void` type function, so it will not return anything concrete, but it adds the leaf values to the `leaves` vector. If `node` is `nullptr`, it stops because the tree is empty. It may be that we have reached the end of a branch of the tree and there are no more nodes to process on that branch. If the current node is a leaf (has no left and right subtrees), add the value of the node to `leaves`. This step must be done to collect the leaf values of a binary tree. If the current node has a left subtree, recursively calls `collectLeaves` for the left subtree. Recursively call `collectLeaves` for the left subtree `collectLeaves(node->left, leaves)` to loop through and collect the leaves of the left subtree. This means that the function will continue to explore the tree down the left side until it hits the leaves. The leaves discovered in this exploration are added to the `leaves` vector.

If the current node has a right subtree, recursively calls `collectLeaves` for the right subtree `collectLeaves(node->right, leaves))` to traverse and collect the leaves of the right subtree. This means that the function will continue to explore the tree down the right side until it hits the leaves. The leaves discovered in this exploration are added to the `leaves` vector.

In conclusion, the `collectLeaves` function recursively traverses the tree and identifies the leaves, adding their values to the `leaves` vector. Check if a node is a leaf by the condition ` !node->left && !node->right`. If true, the value of the node is added to the `leaves` vector. After collecting the leaves for both trees, the leaf vectors are compared to determine if the trees are `leaf-similar`. This approach is efficient and easy to understand, traversing each node only once and thus ensuring `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the total number of nodes in each tree.
