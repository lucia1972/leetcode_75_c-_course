In this problem, our goal is to implement a `pathSum` function that calculates the number of paths in a binary tree where the sum of the node values along each path is exactly equal to a given `targetSum`. To achieve this, we use a combination of recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) and tracking the current sum of visited nodes.

DFS is a technique for exploring tree or graph data structures recursively. As we traverse the tree, we keep track of the sum of the node values. This ensures that all possible paths are explored and checked against the `targetSum` condition.

The `TreeNode` structure represents a node in a binary tree. Each node can have up to two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This structure is commonly used in various algorithmic problems and implementations of different types of trees.

We start our DFS from the root of the tree, recursively traversing each node. The first step in the traversal is to check if the current node is `NULL` with the condition `if(root == NULL) return;`. If the node is `NULL`, we stop because there's nothing to process.

For each node, we add its value (`root->val`) to the current sum and check if this sum equals the `targetSum`. If it does, we increment our counter (`count`) because we've found a path with the desired sum. The variables `count` and `sum` are crucial here. `count` is an integer that tracks the number of paths that meet the `targetSum` condition, while `sum` is a long long variable that holds the sum of node values along the current path.

We then continue our recursive exploration by calling the `solve` function for the left (`solve(root->left, targetSum)`) and right (`solve(root->right, targetSum)`) subtrees of the current node. At the end of each recursive call, we subtract the current node's value from the sum to ensure that we correctly return to the previous state of the sum. This step is essential for backtracking, allowing us to explore other potential paths in the tree without carrying over sums from previous paths.

Without subtracting the current node's value, the sum would include the values of nodes explored in that subtree during subsequent explorations, leading to incorrect sums. This would prevent us from correctly identifying paths that satisfy the `targetSum` condition.

The entire DFS algorithm is encapsulated in an auxiliary function called `solve`, which we use within the `pathSum` function. The `solve` function traverses the tree and checks all possible paths, taking as parameters a pointer to the current node (`root`) and a reference to `targetSum`.

The `pathSum` function initializes the path search process with the desired sum using a recursive approach. It starts by checking if the `root` is `NULL`, which would indicate an empty tree. If the tree is empty, the function returns `0` because there can't be any paths that satisfy the condition.

Next, the `solve` function is called on the root of the tree to search for paths with the sum equal to `targetSum` (`solve(root, targetSum)`). Then, `pathSum` is called recursively on the left child (`pathSum(root->left, targetSum)`) and right child (`pathSum(root->right, targetSum)`) of the root to ensure the entire tree is explored.

The final result is stored in the `count` variable, which represents the total number of paths found with the sum equal to `targetSum`.

To summarize, this solution uses a recursive DFS approach to explore all possible paths in the tree and check if the sum of the values along each path equals `targetSum`. The implementation leverages recursion and backtracking to keep track of the current sum of node values, ensuring that the algorithm is both efficient and correct. By systematically exploring each node and updating the sum, we can accurately count the number of "good" paths that meet the specified condition.

The combination of recursive traversal and maintaining a running sum allows us to efficiently solve this problem, ensuring that each node is visited and evaluated correctly. This approach guarantees that we explore every potential path in the binary tree, providing an optimal solution to the problem at hand.
