In this problem, we are given a singly linked list of integer values, and we need to reorder it so that all nodes with odd indices come before all nodes with even indices, while maintaining their relative order. The goal is to solve this problem with *O(1)* extra space complexity and *O(n)* time complexity.

To achieve this, we will use two helper lists, `oddList` and `evenList`, to collect nodes at odd and even positions, respectively. Once these lists are populated, we will concatenate them to get the final reordered list. This method is efficient in terms of time complexity because we traverse the original list only once to distribute nodes into the two helper lists, and then perform a concatenation operation, which is linear with respect to the size of the lists.

We start by making some initializations. We create dummy nodes, `oddList` and `evenList`, to serve as the heads of the odd and even indexed lists. Dummy nodes simplify the process of managing head pointers. Additionally, we initialize two pointers, `oddPointer` and `evenPointer`, which will help us build the odd and even lists. We also set a `current` pointer to traverse the original list, and an `index` variable to keep track of the node positions, starting from 1 for the first node.

As we traverse the original linked list using the `current` pointer, we use the `index` variable to determine if the node is at an odd or even position. If the node is at an odd position, we append it to the odd list using `oddPointer`. If the node is at an even position, we append it to the even list using `evenPointer`. After processing each node, we move the `current` pointer to the next node and increment the `index`.

After the traversal, the last nodes of both the odd and even lists should point to `nullptr` to mark the end of the lists. This step is important because it ensures there are no residual links from the original list that might interfere with the reordered structure. Next, we link the last node of the odd list to the first node of the even list, forming the final reordered list.

The head of the reordered list is set to the first node of the odd list, which is `oddList->next`. This head node represents the starting point of the reordered list, which now has all odd-indexed nodes followed by all even-indexed nodes. By returning `oddList->next`, we skip the dummy node and get the actual head of the reordered list. This approach ensures that we maintain the relative order of nodes within the odd and even groups and achieve the desired reordering in linear time and constant space.

The method of using dummy nodes and a two-pointer traversal makes the solution both efficient and straightforward. Dummy nodes simplify list manipulations, and the two-pointer technique ensures the list is traversed and reordered in a single pass. This method handles edge cases smoothly, such as lists with only one or two nodes, ensuring the final list is correctly ordered according to the problem's requirements. For example, if the original list has nodes with values [2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 7], after reordering, the nodes should be [2, 3, 6, 7, 1, 5, 4], with all odd-indexed nodes followed by all even-indexed nodes.

Here is how the algorithm works in detail:

We start by initializing a dummy node for the odd-indexed nodes with `ListNode* oddList = new ListNode(0);` and another dummy node for the even-indexed nodes with `ListNode* evenList = new ListNode(0);`. These dummy nodes serve as the heads of the odd and even lists. We use `ListNode* oddPointer = oddList;` to add nodes to the odd list and `ListNode* evenPointer = evenList;` to add nodes to the even list. To traverse the original list, we set `ListNode* current = head;`, and an `int index = 1;` variable to keep track of node positions.

As we traverse the list with a `while` loop, we check if the index is odd using `index % 2 == 1`. For odd indices, we add the node to the odd list with `oddPointer->next = current;` and move the `oddPointer` to the next node. For even indices, we add the node to the even list with `evenPointer->next = current;` and move the `evenPointer` to the next node. After processing each node, we move to the next node in the original list with `current = current->next;` and increment the index with `index++;`.

When we reach the end of the list (i.e., `current` is `nullptr`), we close the odd and even lists by setting `oddPointer->next = nullptr;` and `evenPointer->next = nullptr;`. This ensures that the lists are properly terminated. We then concatenate the two lists by linking the last node of `oddList` to the first node of `evenList` with `oddPointer->next = evenList->next;`.

Finally, we return the reordered list by returning the first node of `oddList`, which is `oddList->next;`. This effectively skips the dummy node and returns the head of the reordered list.

In conclusion, this algorithm effectively reorders a singly linked list by separating nodes into odd and even indexed groups and then concatenating these groups. The use of dummy nodes simplifies the process, and the single traversal of the list ensures the solution is optimal. By maintaining the original relative order within the odd and even groups, the algorithm meets all specified constraints and performs efficiently.

Now, let's test this solution to ensure it works as expected before finalizing it. It's essential to explore different linked list configurations to verify the robustness of the algorithm. Testing should include various scenarios, such as lists with an even number of nodes, lists with an odd number of nodes, very short lists with only one or two nodes, and very long lists with thousands of nodes. This thorough testing process will help identify any potential issues and ensure the solution handles all edge cases correctly. By validating the algorithm across diverse test cases, we can confirm its reliability and efficiency in reordering linked lists as required. This careful approach to testing is crucial for delivering a robust and dependable solution.
