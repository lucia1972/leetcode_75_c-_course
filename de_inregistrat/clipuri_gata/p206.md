To reverse a singly linked list, we need to return the head of the reversed list. This task involves reversing the pointers in the list so that each node points to its previous node instead of the next one. By following a systematic approach, we can achieve this efficiently with *O(1)* extra space complexity and *O(n)* time complexity.

We begin by declaring three pointers: `previous`, `current`, and `nextNod`. Initially, `previous` is set to `nullptr` because there is no node before the head, `current` is set to the head of the list, and `nextNod` is initialized as `nullptr` to hold the reference to the next node during iteration.

Consider a list with nodes `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The goal is to reverse the direction of the pointers so that each node points to its previous node. Starting with the node with value `1`, the `current` pointer is at node `1`, `previous` is `nullptr`, and `nextNod` is `nullptr`. We store the next node, `2`, in `nextNod`. Then, we reverse the link by setting `current->next` to `previous`, making `1` point to `nullptr`. We move the `previous` pointer to `current`, so `previous` now points to `1`. Finally, we move the `current` pointer to `nextNod`, so `current` now points to `2`.

This process is repeated for each node in the list. For the node with value `2`, `previous` points to `1`, `current` points to `2`, and `nextNod` points to `3`. We store the next node, `3`, in `nextNod`, reverse the link by setting `current->next` to `previous`, making `2` point to `1`. We then move `previous` to `current`, so `previous` now points to `2`, and move `current` to `nextNod`, so `current` now points to `3`.

We continue these steps until we reach the end of the list. When `current` becomes `nullptr`, it indicates that we have traversed the entire list and reversed all the links. At this point, `previous` points to the new head of the reversed list.

For the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, after processing all the nodes, the reversed list will be `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. The steps are as follows: starting with node `1`, we reverse the link so that `1` points to `nullptr`, then move to node `2` and reverse the link so that `2` points to `1`. This process continues until the entire list is reversed.

Finally, the function returns `previous`, which is now the head of the reversed list. This process involves iterating through the list, reversing the direction of the links, and adjusting the pointers accordingly.

To summarize, reversing a singly linked list involves initializing `previous` to `nullptr`, `current` to the head, and `nextNod` to `nullptr`. We then iterate through the list, reversing the links at each node and moving the pointers forward. When `current` becomes `nullptr`, the list is fully reversed, and we return `previous` as the new head.

This method efficiently reverses a linked list in *O(n)* time using only three extra pointers, thus maintaining *O(1)* space complexity. This simple and elegant approach leverages pointer manipulation to reverse the list in-place.

Now, let's test this solution to ensure it works as expected. It's crucial to explore different linked list configurations to verify the robustness of the algorithm. Testing should include various scenarios such as lists with different lengths, very short lists with only one or two nodes, and longer lists with many nodes. This thorough testing process will help identify any potential issues and ensure the solution handles all edge cases correctly. By validating the algorithm across diverse test cases, we can confirm its reliability and efficiency in reversing linked lists as required. This careful approach to testing is crucial for delivering a robust and dependable solution.
