In this problem, our goal is to identify the level in a binary tree that has the maximum sum of node values. To achieve this, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. This method will allow us to traverse the tree level by level, calculating the sum of the node values at each level. In the end, we will return the level with the highest sum.

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an efficient method for traversing a tree or graph level by level. It starts at the root and explores all the neighbors of the current node before moving on to the next level. BFS uses a queue to hold the nodes that need to be processed, ensuring that nodes are explored in the order they are discovered. This method is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph and for fully exploring all nodes at each level.

In a binary tree, each node is defined by a structure that contains an integer value and pointers to its left and right children. This structure allows us to represent the hierarchical relationships between the nodes, making it possible to traverse and process the tree in various ways, including BFS.

We will create a class called `Solution` with a public member function named `maxLevelSum`. This function will take the root of the binary tree as a parameter and return an integer representing the level with the maximum sum. The function will employ a BFS traversal to ensure that we process each level in the correct order, calculating the sum of the node values at each level as we go.

To implement this, we will declare a queue to handle the level-by-level traversal of the tree. We will start by adding the root of the tree to the queue. This ensures that the traversal begins at the top of the tree. Additionally, we will need several variables: `max`, initialized to a very small number to hold the highest sum encountered so far; `response`, to keep track of the level with the maximum sum; and `i`, to represent the current level.

As long as the queue is not empty, we will increment the current level `i` to indicate the level we are currently processing. We will use a variable `sum` to calculate the sum of the node values at the current level. To calculate this sum, we will use a loop to extract each node from the queue, add its value to `sum`, and then add its children (if they exist) to the queue to be processed at the next level. This ensures that all nodes at the current level are processed before moving on to the next level.

After processing all nodes at the current level, we will compare the sum with `max`. If the current sum is greater, we will update `max` and store the current level in `response`. This way, we keep track of the level with the highest sum encountered so far.

After traversing all levels of the tree, the `maxLevelSum` function will return the level with the highest sum. This approach guarantees that we process all levels methodically and accurately identify the level with the highest sum.

In conclusion, we have devised an efficient solution for finding the level with the maximum sum in a binary tree using BFS. This method ensures that all levels are processed in order and that the sum of node values is calculated correctly for each level. By using a queue to handle level-by-level traversal and computing the sum of nodes for each level, we ensure linear complexity, making the solution efficient and scalable for large trees. The systematic approach and the use of variables to track the maximum sum and the corresponding level ensure that the final result is accurate and complete.

The BFS approach is particularly well-suited for this problem because it allows us to process each level of the tree independently. This makes it easier to calculate the sum of the node values at each level and compare them to determine the maximum sum. Additionally, BFS ensures that we explore the tree in a systematic manner, which helps to avoid errors and ensures that all nodes are processed.

By employing BFS, we can efficiently explore each level of the tree, calculate the sum of the node values, and determine the level with the maximum sum. This approach guarantees that we process all levels methodically and accurately identify the level with the highest sum, providing an optimal solution to the problem.

In practice, the BFS approach involves using a queue to manage the nodes to be processed. We start by adding the root node to the queue and then process each level in turn. For each level, we calculate the sum of the node values and compare it to the current maximum sum. If the current sum is greater, we update the maximum sum and record the current level as the level with the highest sum. This process continues until all levels of the tree have been processed.

The use of a queue ensures that we process the nodes in the correct order, starting with the root and moving level by level through the tree. This makes the BFS approach both efficient and easy to implement, providing a clear and systematic way to solve the problem. By carefully managing the queue and tracking the sum of the node values at each level, we can accurately determine the level with the maximum sum and return it as the result.
