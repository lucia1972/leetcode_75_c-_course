public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string merged;
        int minLength = min(word1.size(), word2.size());
        for (int i = 0; i < minLength; ++i) {
                merged = merged + word1[i] + word2[i];

```
In this problem, I am given two strings `word1` and `word2`, and my task is to merge these strings together by adding their letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. Additionally, if one string is longer than the other, the remaining letters from the longer string will be added at the end of the merged string. This problem requires a careful and methodical approach to ensure the characters are alternated correctly and any remaining characters are appended properly.

To solve this problem step-by-step, I would first declare the variables `merged` and `minLength`. I would then calculate the minimum value between the lengths of the two strings. This value helps determine how many characters can be alternated between the two strings without exceeding the length of the shorter string. The `minLength` variable will be crucial for controlling the loop that merges the characters.

Next, I need to use a `for` loop to iterate over the characters of the two strings from the start up to `minLength`. During each iteration, I will add the character at position `i` from `word1` and then the character at position `i` from `word2` to the `merged` string. This alternation will continue until the end of the shorter string is reached. This step ensures that the characters from both strings are interleaved correctly up to the length of the shorter string.

Once the loop is completed, there may still be some characters left in the longer string that have not yet been added to `merged`. To handle this, I will append the remaining substring from either `word1` or `word2` to `merged`, starting from `minLength` to the end of the respective string. This ensures that any leftover characters from the longer string are included in the final result.

To put this solution into code, I first declare the string `merged` and the integer variable `minLength`. The `minLength` variable stores the result of the `min()` function, which calculates the minimum value between the lengths of `word1` and `word2`. This function is essential because it provides the boundary for the `for` loop that alternates the characters.

In the `for` loop, I iterate from position 0 to `minLength - 1`. For each iteration, I add the character at the current position `i` from `word1` followed by the character at the same position `i` from `word2` to the `merged` string. This alternation ensures that the characters from both strings are merged in the correct order.

After the loop, there might still be characters left in the longer string. To handle this, I check if there are any remaining characters in `word1` or `word2` starting from `minLength` to the end. If `word1` is longer, I concatenate its remaining substring to `merged`. If `word2` is longer, I concatenate its remaining substring to `merged`.

Finally, I return the `merged` string, which now contains the characters from `word1` and `word2` alternated up to the length of the shorter string, followed by the remaining characters from the longer string.

To sum up this solution, I first determine the minimum length between the two words. Then, I alternate their characters up to this minimum length. Finally, I add any remaining characters from the longer word to the end of the `merged` string. This method ensures that the merging process is both systematic and efficient, producing the desired result accurately.
