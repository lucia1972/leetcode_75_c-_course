                if (!st.empty()) {
                    st.pop();
                }

            }
        }

        // Construct the result string from the stack

        while (!st.empty()) {
            result += st.top();
            st.pop();
        }

        // Since stack pops elements in reverse order, we need to reverse the result string

In this problem, I receive a string of characters that contains letters from the English alphabet and the character `*`. When traversing the array, I need to remove the last non-star character that occurs when I encounter a `*` character, so a stack is suitable for this problem. 
If the current character is a star, I remove the last element before it. There is a guarantee that I can always perform the eliminations because there is always at least one regular character to the left of every `*` character. 
After I remove all the `*` characters and their neighboring characters, I will end up with a single string. This means that no matter how I remove the `*` characters, I will always get the same result, ensuring the uniqueness of the algorithm.

For example, given `s = "leet**cod*e"`:

- `c = 'l'`: The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack. Stack: ['l']
- `c = 'e'`: The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack. Stack: ['l', 'e']
- `c = 'e'`: The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack. Stack: ['l', 'e', 'e']
- `c = 't'`: The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack. Stack: ['l', 'e', 'e', 't']
- `c = '*'`: The character is `*`, so I pop the last character from the stack. Stack: ['l', 'e', 'e']
- `c = '*'`: The character is `*`, so I pop the last character from the stack. Stack: ['l', 'e']
- `c = 'c'`: The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack. Stack: ['l', 'e', 'c']
- `c = 'o'`: The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack. Stack: ['l', 'e', 'c', 'o']
- `c = 'd'`: The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack. Stack: ['l', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'd']
- `c = '*'`: The character is `*`, so I pop the last character from the stack. Stack: ['l', 'e', 'c', 'o']
- `c = 'e'`: The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack. Stack: ['l', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'e']

To solve this problem, I will use a `stack` structure. A `stack` follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, meaning the last element added to the `stack` will be the first to be removed. This is useful for handling the removal of characters when encountering a `*` character.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

First, I prepare an empty stack to receive characters from the string `s`. This stack will help in managing the characters efficiently as I traverse the string.

As I traverse each character in the string, I use a loop to check if the character is a `*`. When I encounter a `*`, I remove the last character from the stack, but only if the stack is not empty. If the character is not a `*`, I simply add it to the stack. 
This ensures that every `*` encountered correctly removes the preceding character, maintaining the integrity of the sequence.

Once I have processed all the characters in the string, I initialize an empty string called `result`. I then iterate through the stack, adding each top element to the `result` string until the stack is empty. This step collects all the remaining characters in the correct order.

Since elements are added to the `result` string in reverse order during the previous step, the final task is to reverse the `result` string to get the correct sequence of characters. This inversion ensures that the final string represents the correct sequence after all `*` operations have been applied.

In conclusion, I utilized a stack to manage the removal of characters efficiently, which ensures the correct order of the remaining characters. 
This approach simplifies the logic and meets the problem requirements. 
Now, let's test this code to ensure it works as expected before submitting it. 
Remember to explore different ideas and implementations because you might encounter a new algorithm that could be better than this one.
