In this problem, our objective is to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a binary tree. According to the definition on Wikipedia, the LCA of two nodes p and q is defined as the lowest node in the tree that has both p and q as descendants (where a node is allowed to be a descendant of itself).

To solve this problem, we use a recursive approach to traverse the binary tree and identify the LCA. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the algorithm:

We start by defining a class `Solution` with a public member function `lowestCommonAncestor`. This function takes three parameters: the root of the binary tree and the two nodes `p` and `q` for which we need to find the LCA. The function returns a pointer to the node that represents the LCA.

The first step in the `lowestCommonAncestor` function is to check if the current node (`root`) is `null` or if it matches either of the nodes `p` or `q`. If any of these conditions are met, we return the current node. This acts as our base case for the recursion. If we reach the end of a branch or find one of the target nodes, we return that node because it could potentially be the LCA or lead us to the LCA.

Next, we proceed to search for the nodes `p` and `q` in the left and right subtrees of the current node. We do this by making recursive calls to the `lowestCommonAncestor` function for the left and right children of the current node.

Once we have the results of these recursive searches, we need to determine if the current node is the LCA. We do this by checking the following condition: if both the left and right subtrees return non-null values, it means both `p` and `q` are found in different subtrees of the current node. Hence, the current node is their lowest common ancestor, and we return it.

If only one of the subtrees returns a non-null value, it means both `p` and `q` are located in that subtree. Therefore, we return the non-null subtree, as it contains the LCA.

If neither of the subtrees returns a non-null value, it means neither `p` nor `q` is present in the current subtree, and we return `null`.

By following this recursive approach, the algorithm efficiently traverses the tree and identifies the LCA. The recursion ensures that we explore all possible paths in the tree, and the conditions we check guarantee that we correctly identify the lowest common ancestor.

This method is effective because it leverages the properties of the binary tree structure, allowing us to systematically reduce the search space at each step. The recursive calls break down the problem into smaller subproblems, making it easier to manage and solve. Moreover, the use of base cases and conditional checks ensures that we correctly identify and return the LCA, providing an accurate and efficient solution to the problem.

The algorithm's effectiveness lies in its ability to utilize the hierarchical nature of binary trees. Each recursive call effectively narrows down the search area by focusing on a smaller subtree. This approach aligns with the divide-and-conquer strategy, where the problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable components. As a result, the algorithm can quickly eliminate large portions of the tree that do not contain the nodes of interest, thus enhancing efficiency.

Furthermore, this recursive approach is inherently elegant due to its simplicity and alignment with the tree's structure. The use of base cases to handle scenarios where the node is null or matches the target nodes ensures that the recursion terminates correctly. Additionally, the way we combine the results of the left and right subtree searches ensures that we correctly identify the LCA when both nodes are found in different subtrees.

To delve deeper into the specifics, consider how the algorithm processes each node. When the `lowestCommonAncestor` function is called, it first checks if the current node is null or if it matches one of the target nodes. This check is crucial as it determines whether the current node can be part of the solution. If the current node is null, it means we have reached the end of a path without finding either of the target nodes, so we return null. If the current node matches one of the target nodes, it could potentially be the LCA, so we return it.

Next, the algorithm proceeds to explore the left and right subtrees by making recursive calls. These calls aim to find the target nodes in the subtrees. By combining the results of these recursive calls, the algorithm can determine the location of the target nodes relative to the current node.

If both the left and right recursive calls return non-null values, it indicates that one target node was found in each subtree, meaning the current node is the LCA. This scenario occurs because the current node is the lowest point where both target nodes converge in the tree. Therefore, the current node is returned as the LCA.

If only one of the recursive calls returns a non-null value, it means that both target nodes are located in the same subtree. Consequently, the algorithm returns the non-null subtree result as it contains the LCA.

In summary, our solution involves recursively traversing the binary tree to find the lowest common ancestor of two given nodes. By checking each node and its subtrees, we can determine the node that serves as the lowest common ancestor, ensuring a correct and efficient resolution to the problem. This recursive approach, combined with the structural properties of binary trees, allows for an elegant and effective solution to finding the LCA in a binary tree.
