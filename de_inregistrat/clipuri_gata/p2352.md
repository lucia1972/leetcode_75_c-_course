Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

In this problem I receive a square matrix of size `n*n`. I need to determine how many of the lines of the matrix are identical to the columns of the matrix.
Specifically, we need to check that the elements on a row are equal and in the same order as the elements on a column.

For `grid = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6],[1, 2, 3]]`
Line 0: `l1 = [1, 2, 3]`
Line 1: `l1 = [4, 5, 6]`
Line 2: `l1 = [1, 2, 3]`
and
Column 0: `c1 = [1, 4, 1]`
Column 1: `c2 = [2, 5, 2]`
Column 2: `c3 = [3, 6, 4]`
I compare each row with each column:
Line 0 - Column 0 `[1, 2, 3] != [1, 4, 1]` (NOT equal)
Line 0 - Column 1 `[1, 2, 3] != [2, 5, 2]` (NOT equal)
Line 0 - Column 2 `[1, 2, 3] != [3, 6, 4]` (NOT equal)
Line 1 - Column 0 `[4, 5, 6] != [1, 4, 1]` (NOT equal)
Line 1 - Column 1 `[4, 5, 6] != [2, 5, 2]` (NOT equal)
Line 1 - Column 2 `[4, 5, 6] != [3, 6, 4]` (NOT equal)
Line 2 - Column 0 `[1, 2, 3] != [1, 4, 1]` (NOT equal)
Line 2 - Column 1 `[1, 2, 3] != [2, 5, 2]` (NOT equal)
Line 2 - Column 2 `[1, 2, 3] != [3, 6, 4]` (NOT equal)

Notice that there are no equal pairs in this example. So the number of equal pairs is 0.

A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:

1. Initialization of variables.
2. Going through the matrix and counting the pairs.
3. Return the final answer.

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Initialization of variables:

```cpp
    int n = grid.size();
    int contor = 0;
```

In this step I prepare the variables I will work with.
`int n = grid.size()` is an integer variable that holds the size of the matrix. I resort to this notation only to simplify the code. It is a variable that can be missing. It uses the function `size()` which is the dedicated function in C++ for determining the number of elements in a data structure. We meet it everywhere in vectors, lists, sets, etc.
The entire `contor` variable initialized to 0 will be used to count the identical pairs (line, column) in the matrix. It will also represent the final answer returned by the `equalPairs` function.

2. Going through the matrix and counting the pairs

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        int ok = 1;
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            if (grid[i][k] != grid[k][j]) {
                ok = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
        contor += ok;
    }
}

```
In this step, I go through the matrix element by element.
I will count the number of times a row `𝑖` in the matrix is ​​identical to a column `j`. On each iteration of the outer loops, the inner loop compares each element of the row with the corresponding element in the column. If all elements are equal, the counter is incremented.
To traverse the matrix I will use nested for loops.

The first 2 loops
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
```
loop through all combinations of rows `i` and columns `j` in the matrix.
With the help of `i` I go through each line and with the help of `j` I go through each column. The elements are indexed with `i' and `j' from 1 to `n-1', that is, on the entire data collection of the matrix.
I then assume that the elements on line `i` and column `j` are equal. For this, we initialized the whole variable `ok` to 1. It will receive the value zero if the elements are not equal. So, this variable, although it is of integer type, has the behavior of a boolean variable.
The third loop goes through each element on row `i` and column `j` and checks if they are equal.

```cpp
  if (grid[i][k] != grid[k][j]) {
      ok = 0;
      break;
  }
```

If for any `k` the element in row `i`at position `k` is different from the element in column `j` at position `k`, i.e. `grid[i][k] != grid[k][j` then the variable `ok` is set to 0 and the loop is stopped using `break`.
The `break` statement in C++ is used to immediately terminate the execution of a loop or `switch control` structure. When break is encountered inside a `for`, `while`, or `do-while` loop, or in a `switch`, program control jumps directly to the next statement after the loop or `switch`.

After exiting the inner loop, if the variable `ok` is still 1, it means that all elements in row `i` coincide with those in column `j`, so `contor` increases by 1. If ok was set to 0, `contor` is not incremented for that pair of row and column.

```cpp 
    contor += ok;
```

3. Return the final answer

```cpp 
    return contor;
```

After going through all the rows and columns, I return the total number of equal pairs, i.e. what the algorithm calculated in the `contor` variable.

In conclusion, I had to loop through a given array to find and count pairs of rows and columns that are identical. Using three `for` loops, the code compares the elements of row `i` with the elements of column `j`. If all elements are identical, the counter is incremented. The `break` statement is essential to stop further checking as soon as a difference is found, making the code more efficient.

Using `for` loops to compare elements and the `break` statement to break the check when a difference is found optimizes the process, saving execution time. Thus, the code is able to quickly and efficiently identify pairs of identical rows and columns in the matrix.
