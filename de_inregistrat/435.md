            } else {
                // If the current interval overlaps, increment the counter
                ++intervalsToRemove;

In this problem, we are given a set of intervals, and the task is to determine the minimum number of intervals that need to be removed to ensure that the remaining intervals do not overlap. The problem can be efficiently solved using an approach based on sorting and iteration. Below, we will walk through the code that implements this solution, using descriptive variable names to enhance clarity.

We start with an array of intervals, where each interval is represented by a vector of two elements `[start, end]`, with `start` being the beginning of the interval and `end` being its end. The goal is to remove the fewest intervals possible so that none of the remaining intervals overlap.

The first step in the solution is to sort the intervals by their end point `end`. Sorting in this way helps us manage overlaps more effectively because it allows us to prioritize keeping intervals that end earlier, thereby maximizing the available space for subsequent intervals.

```cpp
sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const auto& interval1, const auto& interval2) { 
    return interval1[1] < interval2[1]; 
});
```

After sorting, we initialize two key variables:

- `intervalsToRemove`, which counts how many intervals need to be removed to avoid overlaps.
- `lastNonOverlappingEnd`, which stores the end point of the last non-overlapping interval. Initially, this is set to the end of the first interval in the sorted list.

```cpp
int intervalsToRemove = 0;
int lastNonOverlappingEnd = intervals[0][1];
```

We then iterate through the intervals starting from the second element. For each interval, we check if it starts after or exactly at the end of the last non-overlapping interval. If it does, we update `lastNonOverlappingEnd` to reflect the end of the current interval. If it doesnâ€™t, this indicates an overlap, and we increment `intervalsToRemove` because this interval needs to be removed.

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); ++i) {
    if (lastNonOverlappingEnd <= intervals[i][0]) {
        lastNonOverlappingEnd = intervals[i][1];
    } else {
        ++intervalsToRemove;
    }
}
```

Finally, the algorithm returns the number of intervals that need to be removed to achieve a set of non-overlapping intervals.

```cpp
return intervalsToRemove;
```

This approach is efficient, determining the minimum number of intervals that must be removed to prevent overlaps by using a strategy based on sorting and iteration. By sorting intervals by their end points and maintaining a reference to the last non-overlapping interval, the algorithm can efficiently traverse all intervals and identify overlaps.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and it offers a clear and effective method for managing overlaps in a set of intervals, returning the minimum number of necessary removals.

To ensure the robustness and efficiency of the solution, it is important to test the algorithm with various cases, including edge cases such as intervals that completely overlap or are adjacent. This will confirm that the solution works correctly in all scenarios and provides optimal results.
