In this problem, we are given an integer `n`, and the task is to return an array `ans` of length `n + 1`, where each element `ans[i]` represents the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `i`.

The first step is to initialize an array `ans` of size `n + 1` with all elements set to `0`. This initialization is crucial as it prepares the array to store the results that will be calculated during the execution of the algorithm and ensures we have a structure ready to return the final output. The array is initialized with the following code: `vector<int> ans(n + 1, 0);`.

To efficiently calculate the number of `1`s in the binary representation of each number `i`, we will utilize bitwise operations, specifically:

- Right shift (`>>`)
- Bitwise AND (`&`).

In binary representation, each number is represented as a sequence of bits (0s and 1s). For example, in the binary system:

- 0 is `0`
- 1 is `1`
- 2 is `10`
- 3 is `11`
- 4 is `100`
- 5 is `101`
- 6 is `110`
- 7 is `111`

and so forth.

The goal is to determine how many `1` bits are present in the binary representation of each number from 0 to `n`.

For instance, if `n = 7`, the array of results will be `ans = [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3]`.

Using a `for` loop to iterate through all numbers from `1` to `n`, for each number `i`, we will apply the formula `ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1)` to calculate the number of `1` bits in `i`.

This formula consists of two essential components:

1. **`i >> 1`**: This is an operation known as "right shift." In C++, the right shift operator `>>` shifts all bits of the number `i` one position to the right. This operation is equivalent to dividing `i` by 2 and removing the least significant bit (LSB). In other words, it gives us the number of `1` bits in the left portion of `i`.

   For example, for `n = 7`, the result of the operation `i >> 1` represents, in effect, the integer division of `i` by 2.

   - `1 >> 1` gives `0`
   - `2 >> 1` gives `1`
   - `3 >> 1` gives `1`
   - `4 >> 1` gives `2`
   - `5 >> 1` gives `2`
   - `6 >> 1` gives `3`
   - `7 >> 1` gives `3`

   If we know the number of `1` bits in `i >> 1`, we can easily calculate the number of `1` bits in `i` by adding `i & 1`.

2. **`i & 1`**: This is a "bitwise AND" operation. The `&` operator compares the bits of `i` with those of `1`. Specifically, `i & 1` checks if the last bit (LSB) of `i` is `1` or `0`.

   - If the last bit is `1`, the result will be `1`.
   - If the last bit is `0`, the result will be `0`.

   For instance:
   - `1 & 1` is `1`
   - `2 & 1` is `0`
   - `3 & 1` is `1`
   - `4 & 1` is `0`
   - `5 & 1` is `1`
   - `6 & 1` is `0`
   - `7 & 1` is `1`

So, we calculate the number of `1` bits as follows:

- For `i = 1`, `ans[1] = ans[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
- For `i = 2`, `ans[2] = ans[1] + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1`
- For `i = 3`, `ans[3] = ans[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
- For `i = 4`, `ans[4] = ans[2] + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1`
- For `i = 5`, `ans[5] = ans[2] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
- For `i = 6`, `ans[6] = ans[3] + 0 = 2 + 0 = 2`
- For `i = 7`, `ans[7] = ans[3] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`

If `i` is 3 (in binary `11`), then `i & 1` will be `1`, while for `i` equal to 4 (in binary `100`), `i & 1` will be `0`.

Finally, the result is stored in the array `ans`, which will hold the number of `1` bits for each number from `0` to `n`.

This method of using the formula `ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1)` is extremely efficient, with a time complexity of `O(n)`. Thus, we can quickly determine the number of `1` bits in the binary representation of each number within the range from `0` to `n`. This solution demonstrates the power of bitwise operations and dynamic programming in solving computationally efficient problems.

Let's test the solution with different values of `n` to ensure it correctly calculates the number of `1` bits for each number from `0` to `n`. This will confirm the algorithm's accuracy and efficiency across various cases.
