In this problem, we are given an array of strings called `products` and a string `searchWord`. The goal is to design a system that, after each character typed in `searchWord`, suggests up to three product names from `products` that share a common prefix with `searchWord`. If more than three products share the same prefix, we return the first three products in lexicographical order. The final result is a list of lists, where each list contains the suggestions after typing each character in `searchWord`.

To solve this problem efficiently, we start by sorting the products in lexicographical order. Sorting helps us quickly find the first three matching products. As we type each character of `searchWord`, we form the current prefix and search for this prefix in the sorted list of products, collecting the corresponding suggestions. This approach has a time complexity of O(m * n + n log n), where n is the number of products, and m is the length of `searchWord`. The space complexity is O(m) since we store the current prefix.

A more efficient approach involves using a Trie data structure, which allows for fast prefix-based searches. This structure, though it may increase space complexity, significantly reduces time complexity. We construct a Trie from the given products, where each node contains a dictionary of children and a list of suggestions. Each nodeâ€™s list contains up to three products in lexicographical order.

The Trie structure involves nodes, each representing a character in the products. These nodes store pointers to child nodes corresponding to each letter of the alphabet. Additionally, each node holds a list of up to three product names that share the prefix formed from the root to that node.

The insertion process begins at the root node and progresses through each character of the product string. If a node corresponding to a character does not exist, a new node is created. The product is added to the node's list of suggestions, but only if the list contains fewer than three products. This ensures that each node keeps only the top three lexicographical suggestions for the prefix it represents.

Searching for suggestions involves starting at the root and traversing the Trie according to the prefix formed by `searchWord`. For each character typed, we move to the corresponding child node and retrieve the suggestions stored in that node. If at any point a node corresponding to the current prefix does not exist, an empty list is returned for that prefix.

The process of collecting suggestions for each prefix is repeated for every character in `searchWord`, resulting in a list of lists that contains up to three product suggestions for each prefix formed by typing the characters of `searchWord`.

This method effectively handles the requirement to provide up to three lexicographically smallest suggestions for each prefix of `searchWord`. By using a Trie, we achieve efficient insertion and searching operations, ensuring that the system can quickly generate suggestions even as the user continues to type more characters in `searchWord`.

The overall structure of this solution is organized into three key components: the `TrieNode` class, which manages individual nodes in the Trie; the `Trie` class, which oversees the insertion of products and retrieval of suggestions; and the `Solution` class, which integrates these components to solve the problem as described.

In summary, the Trie-based approach efficiently supports the required functionality, allowing the system to provide quick and accurate product suggestions as each character of `searchWord` is typed. This ensures that the solution is both scalable and performant, capable of handling large datasets while maintaining fast response times.

Now it's time to test this code and make sure it works. Our solution is only one example of how this problem can be solved, and you are encouraged to try and improve it.
