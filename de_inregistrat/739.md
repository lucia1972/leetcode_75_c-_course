In this problem, we are given an array of daily temperatures, where each element represents the temperature recorded on a specific day.

For each day in the `temperatures` array, the task is to determine and return a new array that contains, for each day, the number of days that must pass until a future day when the temperature will be higher than on the current day.

If there is no future day with a higher temperature, the corresponding value in the new array should be 0.

To solve this problem, I used a stack-based approach, which allows me to efficiently process each day and quickly find the answer for each previous day that has not yet had a determined result.

The total number of days, which is the size of the `temperatures` array, is stored in a variable `numDays`.

I declare an array of size `numDays` called `daysUntilWarmer` that will contain the number of days until a higher temperature for each day.

The stack that will store the indices from the `temperatures` array is named `indicesStack`. These are the days for which we have not yet found a higher temperature.

Each element in `daysUntilWarmer` is initially set to 0, as we assume that there is no higher temperature in the future for each day.

I then iterate through each position in the `temperatures` array. For each day, I check whether the temperature on the current day is higher than the temperatures for the days stored in the stack.

If the current temperature is higher than the temperature on a previous day, it means we have found the answer for that previous day. I calculate the difference between the current day and the previous day, which tells us how many days need to pass to have a higher temperature. After updating the corresponding value in `daysUntilWarmer`, I remove that day from the stack.

The index of the current day is added to the stack because we have not yet found a future day with a higher temperature for this day.

Finally, we return the `daysUntilWarmer` array, which contains the number of days until a higher temperature for each day.

This algorithm is highly efficient in terms of time complexity, with an O(n) complexity, where `n` is the number of days. Each element in the `temperatures` array is processed only once, either when it is added to the stack or when it is removed from the stack. This efficiency is due to the use of the stack, which allows us to quickly find the next higher temperature for each day.

The algorithm is an optimal solution for determining the number of days until a higher temperature. By using a stack, the algorithm ensures that each day is processed efficiently without the need for unnecessary multiple traversals. This approach offers an excellent balance between code clarity and performance.

To further validate the robustness and efficiency of the solution, it is essential to test the algorithm with various scenarios, including edge cases such as days with constant temperatures or rapidly fluctuating temperatures. This will confirm that the algorithm consistently produces correct and optimal results across all possible input configurations, making it a reliable solution for this type of problem.
