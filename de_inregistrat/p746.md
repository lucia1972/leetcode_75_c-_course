In this problem, I am given an array of integers `cost`, where each element `cost[i]` represents the cost of stepping onto the `i-th` step of a staircase. The goal is to determine the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase. You can start from either the `0-th` or `1st` step, and at each step, you have two options: either move up one step or skip to the next but one step. The challenge is to minimize the total cost required to reach the top.

For example, consider `cost = [10, 15, 20]`. You can start by stepping on the `0-th` step, paying a cost of `10`, then skip directly to the `2nd` step by paying a cost of `20`. The total cost in this case would be `10 + 20 = 30`. Alternatively, you could start from the `1st` step, pay `15`, and then move up to the `2nd` step by paying an additional `20`. The total cost for this path would be `15 + 20 = 35`, which is higher than the previous option. However, if you start from the `1st` step and directly move to the top without taking the `2nd` step, the total cost would be just `15`, which is the lowest possible. Thus, the minimum cost to reach the top is `15`.

To solve this problem, I propose using dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum costs required to reach each step, thus avoiding unnecessary recalculations. The idea is to use a recursive function combined with memoization to efficiently compute the minimal cost for reaching each step.

**Memoization** is an optimization technique primarily used to speed up computations by storing intermediate results. In the context of dynamic programming, memoization involves using a data structure, such as an array or a dictionary, to store the results of subproblems. This allows us to avoid recalculating the cost for steps that have already been processed, thereby saving computation time.

In this algorithm, we declare an integer variable `n` to store the number of steps, which is `cost.size()`, and an array `minimalCost` initialized with `-1` to store the minimum costs for reaching each step. The initial value of `-1` indicates that no value has been calculated yet for that position.

The recursive function `dfs` calculates the minimum cost for reaching a particular step `i`. It takes an integer argument representing the current step and returns the minimal cost to reach that step. The function is defined with `[&]`, meaning it has access to variables `n` and `minimalCost` by reference, allowing it to modify them directly.

If we have gone beyond the last step (`i >= n`), the function returns `0` because there is no need to climb further; we have already reached or exceeded the top of the staircase. The cost for this scenario is `0` since no further steps are needed.

If the minimal cost for the current step `i` has not been calculated (`minimalCost[i] < 0`), the function computes it by adding the current cost to the minimum of the costs for stepping either to the next step (`i + 1`) or skipping to the second step (`i + 2`). The result is stored in `minimalCost[i]` to avoid recalculating it in future recursive calls.

Finally, to determine the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase, I consider two scenarios: starting from step `0` or starting from step `1`. The minimum of these two values is returned as the final result:

For the example `cost = [10, 15, 20]`, the recursive function first calculates the cost for reaching the `2nd` step by calling `dfs(2)`. Since steps `3` and `4` are beyond the last step, `dfs(3)` and `dfs(4)` return `0`. The cost for `minimalCost[2]` becomes `20 + min(0, 0)`, which equals `20`. Next, `dfs(1)` calculates `minimalCost[1]` as `15 + min(dfs(2), dfs(3))`. Since `dfs(2)` has already been computed and stored, `dfs(1)` results in `15`. Finally, `dfs(0)` calculates `minimalCost[0]` as `10 + min(dfs(1), dfs(2))`, resulting in `25`. Using memoization, the function efficiently determines that the minimum cost to reach the top is `15`.

In conclusion, the presented algorithm effectively uses dynamic programming to solve the problem of finding the minimal cost to climb the staircase. By using a recursive function `dfs` and a memoization array `minimalCost`, the algorithm efficiently calculates the minimum costs without redundant recalculations. This ensures that the solution is both optimal and efficient, providing the correct result in a timely manner.

For instance, with the input `cost = [10, 15, 20]`, the algorithm correctly identifies that the minimum cost to reach the top is `15`, which is achieved by starting at step `1` and moving directly to the top. This example demonstrates how dynamic programming can be applied to optimization problems involving costs and sequential decisions.

The algorithm ensures that we can quickly and accurately determine the minimal cost to climb the staircase, utilizing advanced programming techniques to minimize computational effort and resources.

Now, let's test and submit the code to verify its accuracy. It's essential to test the solution across various scenarios, especially edge cases, to ensure its robustness. Additionally, exploring other potential solutions or optimizations can lead to further improvements in efficiency and performance, enhancing problem-solving skills and understanding of dynamic programming.
