In this problem I receive a square matrix of size `n*n`. I need to determine how many of the rows of the matrix are identical to the columns of the matrix.
Specifically, I need to check that the elements on a row are equal and in the same order as the elements on a column.

To better understand this problem, let's take a look at an example.
Let's say I have a matrix with 9 elements.
First, the 3 rows are:
row 0: `l1 = [1, 2, 3]`
row 1: `l2 = [4, 5, 6]`
row 2: `l3 = [1, 2, 3]`

Then, on the columns, I have:
Column 0: `c1 = [1, 4, 1]`
Column 1: `c2 = [2, 5, 2]`
Column 2: `c3 = [3, 6, 4]`

Now, I have to compare each row with each column:
--- First, I compare row 0 with each column. So, I have to compare row 0 with Column 0 which isn't equal, then row 0 with column 1, which again isn't equal, and then row 0 with Column 2 which isn't equal as well. 
    This means that row 0 isn't equal to any column.

--- Next, I compare row 1. row 1 isn't equal to Column 0, it isn't equal to Column 1 and it isn't equal with Column 2 either. So, row 1 also isn't equal to any of the columns.

--- Finally, I compare row 2 with each Column. row 2 isn't equal to Column 0, it isn't equal to Column 1 either, and it isn't equal to Column 2. So, row 2 is also not equal to any of the columns.

Because I am asked to return a number saying how many pairs of rows and columns I can do, I will return 0.

Now, back to the problem.
The steps for solving something like this are to first initialize the variables needed, then to go through the matrix and count the pairs and return the final answer.

First, I initialize my variables. I start by declaring an integer variable `n` which holds the size of the matrix. This type of notation is only meant to simplify the code, making the syntax easier to look at. `n` isn't a neccessary variable, but rather an expandable one. 
I also declare a counter that I named `counter` to 0. This variable will be used to count the identical pairs of row-column in the matrix. It will also represent the final answer returned by the `equalPairs` function.


Next, I need to traverse the matrix and compare each row `i` with each column `j`.
I use nested for loops to iterate through the grid. Nested for loops are a way to loop through a multi-dimensional structure, like a grid or matrix, by having one loop inside another. The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the columns. This allows me to access each element in the grid by its row and column indices.

I loop through each row `i` of the grid. For each row, I then loop through each column `j`. Inside this nested loop, I assume initially that the row `i` and column `j` are equal by setting a flag `ok` to 1.

Flags are variables used to indicate a condition or status. In this case, the flag `ok` is used to keep track of whether the current row and column being compared are equal. By using a flag, I can easily break out of the loop early if a mismatch is found, which can improve efficiency.

I compare each element in the row `i` with the corresponding element in column `j`. If I find any mismatch, I set the flag `ok` to 0 and break out of the comparison loop. This tells me that the row and column are not equal, so there's no need to continue checking further. If the flag `ok` remains 1 after the comparison loop, it means the row and column are equal, and I increment the counter by 1. This way, I can count how many rows and columns are identical in the grid.

After exiting the inner loop, if the variable `ok` is still 1, it means that all elements in row `i` match with those in column `j`, so `counter` increases by 1. If ok was set to 0, `counter` is not incremented for that pair of row and column.

After going through all the rows and columns, I return the total number of equal pairs, meaning what the algorithm calculated in the `counter` variable.

In conclusion, I had to loop through a given array to find and count pairs of rows and columns that are identical. Using three `for` loops, the code compares the elements of row `i` with the elements of column `j`. If all elements are identical, the counter is incremented. The `break` statement is essential to stop further checking as soon as a difference is found, making the code more efficient.

Using `for` loops to compare elements and the `break` statement to break the check when a difference is found optimizes the process, saving execution time. Thus, the code is able to quickly and efficiently identify pairs of identical rows and columns in the matrix.

Now, let's test this code to see if it works. Remember, you can create your own solutions and explore other algorithms and implementations that might be more efficient.
