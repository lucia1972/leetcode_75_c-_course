In this problem, we play a number guessing game. I choose a number from 1 to `n`, and you have to guess which number I chose. Each time you make a guess, I will tell you if the number you are looking for is higher or lower than your guess. You have access to a predefined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results: `-1` if your number is higher than the number I chose, `1` if your number is lower, and `0` if your number is correct. Your goal is to return the number I chose.

For example, if `n = 10` and `pick = 6`, the function should return 6.

To solve this problem, we use the binary search algorithm. This algorithm is suitable because it allows us to halve the search space with each guess, based on feedback from the `guess` function. Binary search is an efficient way to find an element in an ordered list, reducing the number of comparisons required.

First, we initialize two variables, `low` and `high`, to represent the current guessing range. Initially, `low` is `1` and `high` is `n`, meaning the range is the entire set of possible numbers. Calculate the middle value of the current range with `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`. Then, call the function `guess(mid)` to check if `mid` is the chosen number. There are three possible results from this function call: `-1`, `1`, or `0`. Each result must be handled accordingly.

If `guess(mid)` returns `0`, we have found the number and return it. If `guess(mid)` returns `-1`, it means the number chosen is less than `mid`, so we adjust the search range by setting `high = mid - 1`. This means that all values greater than or equal to `mid` are removed from the search range. If `guess(mid)` returns `1`, it means that the number chosen is greater than `mid`, so we adjust the search range by setting `low = mid + 1`.

For example, for `n = 100` and `pick = 30`, the process is as follows: 

start with `low = 1` and `high = 100`. Calculate `mid = (1 + 100) / 2 = 50` and call `guess(50)`, which responds with `-1`, so all numbers greater than 50 are removed. The new range is `[1, 49]`. 
The new middle value `mid = (1 + 49) / 2 = 25` is calculated, and `guess(25)` responds with `1`, so all numbers smaller than 25 are removed. The new range is `[26, 49]`. 
The new middle value `mid = (26 + 49) / 2 = 37` is calculated, and `guess(37)` responds with `-1`, so all numbers greater than 37 are removed. The new range is `[26, 36]`. 
The new middle value `mid = (26 + 36) / 2 = 31` is calculated, and `guess(31)` responds with `-1`, so all numbers greater than 31 are removed. The new range is `[26, 30]`. 
The new middle value `mid = (26 + 30) / 2 = 28` is calculated, and `guess(28)` responds with `1`, so all numbers smaller than 28 are removed. The new range is `[29, 30]`. 
The new middle value `mid = (29 + 30) / 2 = 29` is calculated, and `guess(29)` responds with `1`, so all numbers smaller than 29 are removed. The new range is `[30, 30]`.

Finally, the new middle value `mid = (30 + 30) / 2 = 30` is calculated, and `guess(30)` responds with `0`. We return `30`, and the algorithm stops.

This problem requires us to guess a number between `1` and `n` using an API that tells us if our number is too big, too small, or correct. We use a binary search algorithm to streamline the guessing process, cutting the search interval in half with each guess. We initialize the search range with `low` and `high`, and adjust these limits based on feedback from the `guess` API. If the API indicates that our guess is correct, we return the number. The final line `return -1` is included as a safety measure to ensure that the function returns a valid value in all cases, even though the problem guarantees that there is always a valid answer.

Now, let's test this code to confirm it operates correctly. Feel free to try different scenarios, including edge cases, to validate the solution and deepen your understanding and problem-solving skills.
