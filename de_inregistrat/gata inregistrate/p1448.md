            good = 1;
            maxVal = node->val;

In this problem, we need to determine the number of "good" nodes in a binary tree. A node `X` is considered "good" if there is no node with a value greater than `X` on the path from the root to `X`. Essentially, we are looking for nodes that are greater than or equal to all the nodes encountered from the root to that particular node.

To solve this, we need to traverse the tree and check each node to see if it’s "good". During the traversal, we keep updating the maximum value encountered so far. This allows us to determine if the current node is "good" by comparing its value with the maximum value seen on the path from the root. We use a recursive approach to handle this traversal effectively.

We start with a function named `goodNodes` which initiates the recursive process with the root node and its value. The main recursive function, `countGoodNodes`, is responsible for checking if the current node is "good" by comparing its value to the maximum value encountered so far on the path from the root to the node. If the node is "good" (i.e., `node->val >= maxVal`), it means its value is at least as great as the maximum value seen up to that point. When this condition is met, we mark the node as good by setting `good = 1` and update the maximum value to `maxVal = node->val`.

Next, we call the `countGoodNodes` function recursively for both the left and right subtrees. We add the number of good nodes found in these subtrees to the current count. This recursive call is done using the expression `good + countGoodNodes(node->left, maxVal) + countGoodNodes(node->right, maxVal)`. By recursively traversing the tree, we ensure that all nodes are checked and counted if they meet the "good" node criteria.

Consider the tree `[3,1,4,3,null,1,5]`. The root node `3` is always "good" because it has no ancestors to compare against. Moving to node `1` on the left, it's not "good" since `1` is less than `3`, the maximum value encountered so far. The next node `4` on the right of the root is "good" because `4` is greater than `3`, the maximum value encountered on the path from the root. Node `3` in the left subtree of node `1` is "good" because it matches the maximum value encountered on its path. Finally, node `5` is "good" because `5` is greater than all the values on the path from the root to this node. Thus, the total number of good nodes in this tree is 4.

This recursive approach is very effective for this problem. The function `countGoodNodes` starts with the root and traverses down the tree. For each node, it checks if the node’s value is greater than or equal to the maximum value encountered so far. If it is, the node is marked as "good", and the maximum value is updated. This process is repeated for each node until the entire tree has been traversed.

The key to understanding this approach lies in recognizing that we are maintaining a running maximum value as we traverse from the root to each node. By doing this, we can efficiently determine whether a node is "good" based on the values of its ancestors. The recursion ensures that each node is visited only once, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the total number of nodes in the tree.

Another important aspect of this solution is how it handles the tree traversal. By using a pre-order traversal (processing the current node before its children), we can ensure that we are always comparing each node against the correct maximum value seen so far. This way, when we visit each node, we can accurately determine its status as "good" or not.

Additionally, the use of a helper function `countGoodNodes` allows for a clean and modular approach to solving the problem. By separating the initialization of the recursion in the `goodNodes` function from the actual recursive logic in `countGoodNodes`, the code becomes easier to understand and maintain.

In summary, this algorithm effectively traverses the entire tree and counts the "good" nodes by comparing each node's value with the maximum value encountered on the path from the root to that node. The recursion handles the traversal and comparison efficiently, ensuring that each node is processed only once. This approach guarantees an optimal calculation of the number of "good" nodes in the given binary tree. By maintaining a running maximum and using pre-order traversal, we ensure that the solution is both straightforward and efficient. This method not only meets the problem requirements but also demonstrates the power of recursive tree traversal in solving complex tree-based problems.

Now, it's time to put this implementation to the test. Don't hesitate to experiment with your own ideas and explore other potential solutions to the problem.
