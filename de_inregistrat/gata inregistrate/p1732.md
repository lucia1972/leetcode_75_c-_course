For this problem, I know that a biker is going on a road trip. There are `n+1` points of different altitudes on this road trip. He starts the trip on point `0` where the altitude is `0`.
What I get is an integer array `gain` of length `n`. _The net gain in altitude_ between the 2 points `i` and `i+1` is represented by `gain[i]`.

Let's take a look at an example to better understand what this problem requires. 
Suppose `gain` equals `[-5, 1, 5, 0, -7]`.
We know from the start that the initial point, point `0`, has an elevation of `0`.
So, for now, the altitude stored in `alt` is 0. Next, I start traversing the array. 

--- On point 1, `gain[i]` is equal to `-5`. I add `-5` to `alt`, which equals `-5`. I store this value in `alt`. I then go forward and check if the current `alt` is greater than `max`, which is 0. It isn't, so `max` is still 0, and `alt` is still `-5`.

--- On point 2, `gain[i]` equals `1`. I add 1 to `alt`, which is `-5`, and I get `-4`. I store that in `alt`, and, again, I check if it's greater than `max`. It isn't so I move on.

--- On point 3, `gain[i]` equals `5`. I add 5 to `alt`, which is `-4`, and I get `1`. I store that in `alt` and then I check if it's bigger than `max`. We now got a value bigger than `max`, which is 0, so `max` becomes 1 and `alt` also equals 1.

--- On point 4, `gain[i]` equals `0`. When added to `alt`, `alt` remains on 1.

--- And, on point 5, the last point, `gain[i]` equals `-7`. When added to `alt`, I get `-6`, which I know isn't greater than `max`. 

So, when I am done traversing the array, I get `alt` equals `-6`, and `max` equals `1`. So, my ultimate answer is `1`.

To solve this problem in C++, I used a simple `O(n)` linear traversal algorithm to determine the highest altitude reached during a route given by the `gain` array. This algorithm is also known as a "prefix sum" or a "running sum", where I calculate the cumulative sum of the elements of an array to obtain useful information about intermediate and final values.

I start by declaring 2 variables: `max` and `alt`, both initialized to 0.
--- `max` will hold the value of the highest altitude reached
--- and `alt` will store the current altitude as we cycle through the `gain` array

Next, I perform a linear traversal of the array using a `for` loop.

On each iteration, I update the current altitude `alt` by adding the current value from `gain`. This value can be either positive or negative.

After updating the current altitude, I check if `alt` is greater than `max`. If so, I update `max` with `alt`.

After the loop has gone through all the elements in the array, I return the value from `max`, which is the highest altitude reached.

The linear traversal algorithm used in this solution is efficient due to its simplicity and has an `O(n)` time complexity. It ensures that each element of the `gain` array is processed only once, and it constantly updates operations.

This type of algorithm is useful for problems involving cumulative sums or sequences of data that need to be analyzed in a continuous and progressive manner.

Let's test the code to ensure it works before submitting it. Keep in mind that there are various ways to implement any algorithm. Feel free to explore different approaches, optimize, and rewrite the code to potentially achieve a more efficient solution.
