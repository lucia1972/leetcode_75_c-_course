            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                right = mid; // we search the left side, including mid
            } else {
                left = mid + 1; // search on the right side, excluding mid
            }

    }
};

Given an array of integers called `nums`, the task is to write an optimized algorithm with a time complexity of `O(log n)` to identify the positions in the array where peak elements are located. 
A peak element is defined as an integer that is strictly larger than its neighboring elements. 
For example, in the array `nums = [1, 1, 0, 3, 5, 6, 4]`, the function should return `5` because `nums[5] = 6` is greater than both `nums[4] = 5` and `nums[6] = 4`.

To achieve the required time complexity, we can use the binary search technique. 
This method is effective because it reduces the search space by half with each step, ensuring that the algorithm runs in logarithmic time. 
We start by initializing two variables, `left` and `right`, which represent the bounds of the search range. `left` is set to the beginning of the array, and `right` is set to the end of the array. 
As long as the condition `left < right` is true, we continue searching through the `nums` array. 
At each iteration, we calculate the middle index of the current search range and store it in the variable `mid` using the formula `int mid = left + (right - left) / 2`.

Next, we compare the middle element with its right neighbor. 
If the middle element `nums[mid]` is greater than its right neighbor `nums[mid + 1]`, there is a possibility of finding a peak on the left side of the current range, including the `mid` element. 
Therefore, we adjust the `right` boundary to `mid`. If `nums[mid]` is less than or equal to `nums[mid + 1]`, it indicates that a peak might be present on the right side of the current range, excluding the `mid` element. 
Thus, we adjust the `left` boundary to `mid + 1`. 
This process is repeated until the search range becomes empty, which happens when `left` is no longer less than `right`.

To illustrate how this works, let's walk through the example `nums = [1, 1, 0, 3, 5, 6, 4]`. We initialize `left = 0` and `right = 6`, making the initial search range `[0, 6]`. 
In the first iteration, we calculate `mid` as `3` and compare `nums[mid]` (which is `3`) with `nums[mid + 1]` (which is `5`). 
Since `3` is not greater than `5`, we move the `left` boundary to `mid + 1`, making the new search range `[4, 6]`. 
In the second iteration, we calculate `mid` as `5` and compare `nums[mid]` (which is `6`) with `nums[mid + 1]` (which is `4`). 
This time, `6` is greater than `4`, so we move the `right` boundary to `mid`, making the new search range `[4, 5]`. 
In the third iteration, we calculate `mid` as `4` and compare `nums[mid]` (which is `5`) with `nums[mid + 1]` (which is `6`). 
Since `5` is not greater than `6`, we move the `left` boundary to `mid + 1`, making the new search range `[5, 5]`. 
At this point, the `left < right` condition is no longer true, so the loop terminates. 
The value at the `left` index, which is `5`, is returned as it indicates the position of the peak element in the original array.

This example demonstrates how binary search efficiently narrows down the search interval by halving it at each step, which enhances the efficiency of the peak-finding process. 
The problem of finding a peak element in an array can be efficiently solved using the binary search technique. 
By leveraging two boundaries, `left` and `right`, we continually adjust the search range based on the comparison of the middle element with its neighbors. 
This ensures that the algorithm operates with a time complexity of `O(log n)`, making it well-suited for large arrays. 
The binary search method is particularly advantageous for search and selection problems in ordered or partially ordered collections, offering a robust and elegant solution for identifying peak elements in an array.

After implementing the code, itâ€™s essential to test it to ensure its correctness. 
Keep in mind that exploring different implementations or trying other algorithms can further enhance your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding of this technique.
