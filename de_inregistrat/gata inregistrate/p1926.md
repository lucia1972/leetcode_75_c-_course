In this problem, we need to determine the shortest path from the entrance of a maze to the nearest exit. The maze is represented by an `m x n` matrix, where empty cells are denoted by `.` and walls are denoted by `+`. The entrance to the maze is given by the coordinates `[entrancerow, entrancecol]`. For each movement through the matrix, we are only allowed to take one step in one of four directions: left, right, up, or down. We cannot step into a cell that is a wall or go outside the maze's perimeter.

To solve this problem, we will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is well-suited to this problem because it explores all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level, thereby guaranteeing that it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph. In this case, the maze can be modeled as an unweighted graph where each move from one cell to an adjacent cell is considered a unit of movement with an equal cost of one step.

The problem is transformed into a graph traversal problem, where each cell in the maze represents a node, and each possible move (up, down, left, right) represents an edge between nodes. Since all moves are equivalent and there are no weights associated with them, the graph is unweighted.

For the BFS traversal, we initialize a queue and add the entrance point to it. This point is then marked as visited to avoid revisiting it. The dimensions of the maze are stored in the variables `m` and `n`. We use an array `dirs` to simplify the calculation of new positions based on the four possible movement directions (up, down, left, right). This array helps us calculate the new `(x, y)` coordinates when moving from one cell to another.

In the main BFS loop, we increment a counter `ans` to track the number of steps taken. For each cell at the current level, we check all four possible directions. If the new position is within the maze boundaries and the cell is empty, we check if it is at the edge of the maze. If it is, we return the current step count as the shortest path. If it is not at the edge, we add the new position to the queue and mark it as visited.

If the BFS completes without finding an exit, we return `-1`, indicating that there is no possible path to an exit.

For example, if the entrance is at position `[1, 1]` in a 3x3 maze, and we can move to positions `[1, 2]`, `[2, 1]`, `[1, 0]`, and `[0, 1]`, we will check each direction. If any of these positions lead to an exit, we return the number of steps taken to reach there. If not, we add the valid moves to the queue and continue the BFS process until all positions are explored or an exit is found.

This approach guarantees that the solution is optimal in terms of the number of steps. The BFS algorithm effectively handles the maze's structure by treating it as an unweighted graph, where each cell is a node and each move is an edge of equal weight. This ensures that the shortest path is found without additional overhead or complexity.

In conclusion, the BFS algorithm is suitable for this problem because it explores all nodes at the same level before moving to the next, thus guaranteeing the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Using the queue and the `dirs` vector simplifies the calculation of new coordinates and the management of visited cells. The algorithm is robust and efficient, capable of handling unweighted maze and graph navigation problems, providing an optimal and clear solution.
