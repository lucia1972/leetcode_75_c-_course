In this problem, we need to create a `pathSum` function that counts the number of paths in a binary tree where the sum of the node values in each path equals a given `targetSum`. To achieve this, we use Depth-First Search (DFS) combined with sum tracking.

DFS is a method used to explore tree structures recursively. As we traverse the tree, we keep a running total of the node values to check against the `targetSum`. This allows us to explore all possible paths and ensure that we correctly identify paths that meet the target condition.

Each node in the tree is represented by a `TreeNode` structure. A `TreeNode` can have up to two children: a left child and a right child. The value of each node contributes to the sum of the path that passes through it.

We start our DFS from the root of the tree. The first step in the traversal is to check if the current node is `NULL`. If the node is `NULL`, we stop the traversal because there is nothing to process. This check is crucial to prevent errors when we reach the end of a branch in the tree.

For each node, we add its value to the current sum and check if this sum equals the `targetSum`. If it does, we increment our `count` because we have found a valid path that meets the condition. The variables `count` and `sum` play crucial roles here. `count` tracks the number of paths that meet the `targetSum` condition, while `sum` holds the cumulative sum of node values along the current path.

After checking the current node, we continue our DFS by recursively calling the `solve` function on the left and right children of the current node. This recursive exploration ensures that we traverse all possible paths in the tree. At the end of each recursive call, we subtract the current node's value from the sum to backtrack correctly. This step is essential for maintaining the correct sum as we explore different paths. By subtracting the current node's value, we ensure that the sum does not include the values of nodes from previously explored subtrees, which would lead to incorrect sums and prevent us from identifying valid paths.

Backtracking is a crucial part of the algorithm. Without backtracking, the sum would accumulate values from all previously explored nodes, leading to incorrect results. By subtracting the current nodeâ€™s value when returning from a recursive call, we reset the sum to its previous state, allowing us to correctly explore other potential paths in the tree.

The entire DFS algorithm is encapsulated in an auxiliary function called `solve`, which is used within the `pathSum` function. The `solve` function takes as parameters a pointer to the current node and a reference to `targetSum`. This function handles the recursive traversal, sum tracking, and path checking.

The `pathSum` function initiates the path search process with the desired sum using a recursive approach. It starts by checking if the `root` is `NULL`, which would indicate an empty tree. If the tree is empty, the function returns `0` because there can't be any paths that satisfy the condition. This initial check is important to handle edge cases where the input tree is empty.

Next, the `solve` function is called on the root of the tree to search for paths with a sum equal to `targetSum`. After processing the root, `pathSum` is called recursively on the left and right children of the root to ensure that the entire tree is explored. This recursive call ensures that we consider all possible paths starting from each node in the tree, not just those starting from the root.

The final result is stored in the `count` variable, which represents the total number of paths found with a sum equal to `targetSum`. This variable is updated throughout the recursive traversal as we find paths that meet the condition.

To summarize, this solution uses a recursive DFS approach to explore all possible paths in the tree and check if the sum of the values along each path equals `targetSum`. The implementation leverages recursion and backtracking to keep track of the current sum of node values, ensuring that the algorithm is both efficient and correct. By systematically exploring each node and updating the sum, we can accurately count the number of paths that meet the specified condition.

Now, let's test this algorithm to ensure it works correctly. Experimenting with various tree configurations will help verify its reliability and ability to handle diverse scenarios effectively.
