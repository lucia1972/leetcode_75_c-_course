In this problem, we are given two strings, `text1` and `text2`, and the task is to determine the length of the longest common subsequence between these two strings. If no common subsequence exists, the function should return `0`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string by deleting some (or no) characters without altering the relative order of the remaining characters. For instance, if `text1 = "abcde"` and `text2 = "ace"`, then `ace` is a subsequence of `abcde`. The common subsequences between these two strings include `a`, `c`, `e`, `ac`, `ae`, `ce`, and `ace`. Among these, the longest common subsequence is `ace`, which has a length of `3`.

To solve this problem, dynamic programming is the most effective approach. The idea is to construct a two-dimensional table `lcs` where `lcs[i][j]` will store the length of the longest common subsequence of the prefixes `text1[0..i-1]` and `text2[0..j-1]`. Here, `m` and `n` represent the lengths of `text1` and `text2`, respectively.

The first step in implementing this approach is to initialize the table `lcs` with dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)`, where each element is set to `0`. The extra row and column are added to handle the base case where one of the strings is empty, resulting in a longest common subsequence of length `0`. This initialization ensures that when we compare the characters of the two strings, we have a straightforward way to handle cases where either of the strings has no characters left to compare.

Next, we iterate over each character of `text1` and `text2` using two nested `for` loops. For each pair of characters `(text1[i-1], text2[j-1])`, we update the `lcs` table based on whether the characters match or not:

1. If `text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]`, it means that these characters contribute to a common subsequence. Therefore, we add `1` to the length of the longest common subsequence found so far for the prefixes `text1[0..i-2]` and `text2[0..j-2]`. This is represented by the formula `lcs[i][j] = lcs[i-1][j-1] + 1`.

2. If the characters do not match, we must determine the maximum length of the longest common subsequence possible by either excluding the current character of `text1` or `text2`. This is done by taking the maximum of the two possibilities: `lcs[i-1][j]` and `lcs[i][j-1]`.

By the end of these iterations, the value stored in `lcs[m][n]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `text1` and `text2`. This value is returned as the final answer.

For example, if `text1 = "abcde"` and `text2 = "ace"`, the `lcs` table will be filled as follows:

- Initially, the table is filled with zeros.
- As we iterate through the characters of `text1` and `text2`, we update the table based on matches or mismatches.
- By the end of the process, the bottom-right cell of the table will contain the length of the longest common subsequence, which in this case is `3` (corresponding to the subsequence `ace`).

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(m * n)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings. This is because we need to fill out an `m x n` table, and each entry requires constant time to compute. The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` because of the storage required for the table.

In conclusion, dynamic programming provides an efficient and intuitive solution to the problem of finding the longest common subsequence between two strings. By storing intermediate results in a two-dimensional table, the algorithm avoids redundant calculations and ensures optimal performance. The systematic traversal of the two strings, combined with the update of the `lcs` table, guarantees that we correctly compute the maximum length of the common subsequence. This method is particularly well-suited for handling strings of considerable length, making it a powerful tool in solving similar string-related problems.

With the algorithm implemented, it is essential to thoroughly test it across various cases, including edge cases such as one or both strings being empty, to ensure it performs correctly in all scenarios. This will confirm the robustness of the solution and its ability to handle different inputs effectively.
