In this problem, we need to implement a Trie class that supports the following operations:

- **Inserting a word:** Adding a word to the Trie.
- **Searching for a word:** Checking if a word exists in the Trie.
- **Searching for a prefix:** Checking if there is any word in the Trie that starts with a given prefix.

First, let's discuss what a Trie is.

A Trie is a tree-like data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of keys, particularly strings. Each node in a Trie corresponds to a character in a string, making it ideal for applications like autocomplete or spell checking.

The name "Trie" comes from "retrieval," emphasizing its primary purpose: fast data retrieval. Tries are commonly used in applications that require quick searches, such as search engine suggestions, spell checkers, or contact searches in phone directories.

For example, in autocomplete, Tries enable quick suggestions based on the sequence of characters the user types. This efficiency is due to the organized structure of Tries, which reuse common paths among strings with the same prefixes, reducing search time. In spell checking, Tries allow for the rapid identification of valid words and suggest corrections for misspelled ones.

A crucial feature of a Trie is its ability to efficiently utilize shared paths for strings with similar prefixes. For instance, the words "cat" and "car" would share the same path for the first two characters ("c-a"). This common path saves space and speeds up searches. The paths diverge only at the third character, where "t" leads to "cat" and "r" leads to "car." This efficient structure allows for quick storage and retrieval of words, minimizing redundancy and maximizing performance.

A Trie's structure consists of ordered nodes, each representing a unique character. The size of a Trie depends on the number of characters in the alphabet (e.g., 26 for the English alphabet), and its depth is determined by the length of the longest word stored.

Each node in the Trie marks a specific position in the stored strings, and traversing from the root to a leaf node forms a complete word. This organization enables Tries to effectively distinguish between prefixes and complete words, which is critical for fast search and validation operations.

To solve this problem, I created a constructor for the Trie class that initializes a Trie object with an array of 26 pointers, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet. This array of pointers manages the tree's branches from each Trie node. Additionally, the constructor sets the `isEnd` variable to `false`, indicating that no node initially represents the end of a word. Essentially, this constructor creates an empty Trie, ready to store words.

Next, I implemented the functions necessary to perform the required operations.

- **The `insert` function** adds a word to the Trie. It iterates through each character in the word and checks if there is already a corresponding node for that character in the Trie. If not, it creates a new one. After inserting all characters, the final node is marked as the end of a word by setting `isEnd` to `true`. This function is essential for building the Trie's structure based on the inserted words.

- **The `search` function** checks if a given word exists in the Trie. It uses the helper function `searchPrefix` to find the prefix that corresponds to the entire word in the Trie. If the node corresponding to the last character of the word is found and marked as the end of a word (`isEnd` is `true`), the function returns `true`, indicating that the word exists in the Trie. If not, it returns `false`. This function allows for quick searches of words stored in the Trie.

- **The `startsWith` function** checks if there is a word in the Trie that starts with a specific prefix. Like `search`, it uses `searchPrefix` to find the prefix in the Trie. If the node corresponding to the last character of the prefix is found (i.e., it is not `nullptr`), the function returns `true`, indicating that at least one word in the Trie starts with that prefix. Otherwise, it returns `false`. This function is useful for implementing autocomplete features.

- **The `searchPrefix` function** is a helper function that aids in searching for a prefix in the Trie. It iterates through each character in the prefix and checks if there is a corresponding node in the Trie. If a node exists for each character, the function returns the final node. If not, it returns `nullptr`. This function is essential for efficiently implementing the `search` and `startsWith` functions, allowing traversal of the Trie up to the node corresponding to the last character of a word or prefix.

Thus, I implemented an efficient Trie for storing and searching words, organizing characters into a tree that allows for fast insertion, search, and prefix verification operations. Each function in the Trie class plays a crucial role in maintaining the tree structure and performing the necessary operations to meet the problem's requirements. This implementation is ideal for efficiently managing a large set of words and can be used in applications like autocomplete or spell checking.


In conclusion, Tries are highly efficient data structures for applications that require fast and precise searches in large sets of strings. Due to their unique organization and reuse of common paths, Tries are indispensable for optimizing the performance of applications involving complex and frequent searches.
Finally, it's important to test the Trie implementation with different sets of words and prefixes to ensure it correctly handles various cases, including edge cases like empty strings or very long words. This will confirm the reliability and efficiency of the implemented Trie.
