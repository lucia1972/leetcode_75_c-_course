The costs of hiring a group of workers is kept in a `costs` array. Each `costs[i]` element represents the cost of hiring the `i`th worker.

I am asked that in `k` hiring sessions, where `k` is an initially known integer, to hire a number of candidates given as an input parameter in the `totalCosts` function in the integer variable `candidates`, so that in each hiring session I will take the lowest cost worker from either the first candidate workers or the last candidate workers.

In the end, I have to return the total cost to hire the `k` workers.

For example, if `costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8]`, `k = 3` and `candidates = 2`

--- hiring session 1 I will choose the 3rd worker `costs[3] = 2` because it has the lowest cost - and `costs = [17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8 ]`;

--- hiring session 2 I will choose the fourth worker `costs[4] = 2` because it has the lowest cost - and `costs = [17,12,10,7,11,20,8]`;

--- hiring session 3 I will choose the third worker `costs[3] = 7` because it has the lowest cost - and `costs = [17,12,10,11,20,8]`.

So the total cost will be `2 + 2 + 7 = 11`.


To implement the algorithm to solve this problem, I will once again use a `min-heap` (priority queue) to efficiently select the lowest costs between the first values ​​in the `candidates` and the last values ​​in the `candidates` elements of the array `costs`.

If `candidates * 2` is greater than the length of the array, it means that practically all elements of the array are considered candidates. In this case, sorting the array and selecting the first `k` elements becomes a simple and straightforward solution.
By sorting the array in ascending order and then taking the first `k` elements, I guarantee that I select the lowest possible `k` costs. This is an effective approach to minimize the total cost when the number of candidates is large enough to cover the entire array or nearly the entire array.

```cpp 
    int n = costs.size();
    if (candidates * 2 > n) {
        sort(costs.begin(), costs.end());
        return accumulate(costs.begin(), costs.begin() + k, 0LL);
    }

```

I define a `min-heap` (priority_queue) costIndex to handle the selection of cost and index pairs.

`priority_queue<couple, vector<couple>, greater<couple>> costIndex;`

This is a data structure from the C++ STL that implements a heap.

The definition for couple is an alias type declaration, which allows us to define an alias for an existing type. `pair<int, int>` is the type for which we define the alias. In this case, `couple` will represent a pair of `pair<int, int>` integers. Using pairs is convenient when we want to store two related values, such as a cost and its associated index.

```cpp
using couple = pair<int, int>;
priority_queue<couple, vector<couple>, greater<couple>> costIndex;
```

The defined structure therefore has elements of type `couple` and `vector<couple>` specifies that the underlying structure used to store the elements is a vector of pairs and `greater<couple>` specifies that I want to use a comparator to transform priority_queue into a min-heap. The `greater()` function will arrange the elements in ascending order so that the smallest element is at the top of the heap.

After the complete definition of this structure, I initialize the min-heap `costIndex` with

--- the first `candidates` elements, i.e. `costIndex.emplace(costs[i], i);` that is, I add the element from the `costs` array to position `i` in the heap. `costs[i]` represents the cost and `i` is the index.

--- the last `candidates` elements, i.e. `costIndex.emplace(costs[n - i - 1], n - i - 1);` from the costs array, that is, I add the element from the costs array from position `n - i - 1` in the heap, where `n - i - 1` represents the index of the last candidates in the array.

```cpp 
    for (int i = 0; i < candidates; ++i) {
        costIndex.emplace(costs[i], i);
        costIndex.emplace(costs[n - i - 1], n - i - 1);
    }
```

This ensures that the initial minimum cost selection is made from these two segments of the array.

The `emplace()` function we used here is a useful method available in many containers in the C++ STL, including priority_queue. It allows inserting a new element directly into the container by constructing the element in the destination place, which can be more efficient than inserting a copy of an already constructed object.

In other contexts I used `push()` function which adds a copy of the object to the container. This means that the object must first be constructed and then copied or moved into the container. Unlike `push()`, the `emplace()` function builds the object directly into the container, eliminating the need for an additional copy or move.

To perform the selection of the elements with the minimum cost, I need to initialize the long long `ans` type variable to keep the total sum of the minimum costs, and the variables `l` and `r` are the indices for the next elements to be added to the heap from the left and right side of the array .

Using a repetitious structure with an indefinite number of `while` steps, I will iterate continuously until I have selected `k` elements. I start from the given `k` and after each iteration I decrement it by one unit. When it becomes null, the loop is left but we have already selected `k` elements.

The purpose of this `while` loop is to select the `k` elements with minimum cost from the heap `costIndex` on the one hand and to update the total sum `ans` and add the necessary elements to the heap to continue the efficient selection.

The first step consists in accessing the pair `(cost, i)` with the minimum cost from the heap without removing it.

After selecting it and holding it `auto [cost, i] = costIndex.top();` i can remove it from the heap `costIndex.pop();` and then increment the `ans` variable with the cost found in this pair.

I check if we haven't reached the middle element, that is, if `l` (the current index on the left) is greater than `r` (the current index on the right), it means that we have exhausted the elements in the middle and we have no more elements to add to the heap.

```cpp
    if (l > r) {
        continue;
    }

```
If `i < l` means the index `i` of the element extracted from the heap is less than `l` it means that the element comes from the left segment. I add the next element from the left segment to the heap using `costIndex.emplace(costs[l], l++)`. Otherwise, if `i >= l`, that means the `i` index of the element extracted from the heap is greater than or equal to `l`, it means that the element comes from the right segment. We add the next element from the right segment to the heap using `costIndex.emplace(costs[r], r--)`.

```cpp

    if (i < l) {
        costIndex.emplace(costs[l], l++);
    } else {
        costIndex.emplace(costs[r], r--);
    }
```
In conclusion, this algorithm uses a min-heap to efficiently select the lowest costs among the first and last `candidates` elements of an array `costs`, to hire `k` workers at the lowest total cost. I initialize the heap with the first and last `candidates` elements and iterate to select `k` minimum costs, updating the total sum `ans`. If the number of candidates is too large for the array, I sort the array and take the first `k` elements. This approach ensures efficiency and an optimization of costs, returning the minimum possible amount for hiring workers.

Now, it's time to test this code to ensure it works properly. You can experiment with different scenarios, including edge cases, and explore other implementations. This approach will not only help confirm the solution but also boost your understanding and problem-solving abilities.
