Hello, and welcome to my course!

I am Ana Negreanu-Maior, and I will be your instructor for this course. 

Here, we will tackle the 75-problem challenge on LeetCode and solve the full set of problems in C++. 

This course is actually part of an ongoing series that we are going to launch in which we will solve this list in multiple programming languages, each time exploring new ways to solve these problems. 

If you are interested in the algorithms for these problems in other programming languages, then stay tuned to find out more. Also, feel free to follow us on social media or join our Discord community, where we will release constant updates relating to our products, ongoing growth, and other fun surprises.

Now, back to the course. 

Our main idea for this course was to take each problem, break it down into steps, and then explore a beginner-friendly approach to solving them. 

We discuss all the different topics that have been listed by LeetCode on that list, like two pointers, the sliding window technique, backtracking, or binary search trees.

Throughout this course, I encourage you to engage actively—ask questions, share your thoughts, and experiment with the code on your own. 

The more you practice, the more confident you'll become. 

Remember, problem-solving is a skill that grows with each attempt, and persistence is key.

This course is designed for learners of all levels. 

Whether you're a beginner just starting out with C++ or someone looking to refine your coding skills, you'll find valuable insights and practical strategies here. 

My goal is to not just teach you how to solve these problems but to help you develop a problem-solving mindset that you can apply beyond LeetCode.

I’m committed to your success, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. 

Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification on any topic.

I look forward to working with you on this exciting journey and helping you unlock your full potential as a C++ programmer!
