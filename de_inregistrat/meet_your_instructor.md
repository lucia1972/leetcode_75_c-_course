**Welcome to the Course!**

Hello, I’m Ana Negreanu-Maior, and I’ll be your instructor throughout this exciting journey. I am part of the LAN Academy team, along with Lucia and Adrian Negreanu-Maior.
In this course, I will guide you through solving each problem in LeetCode's "75-problem challenge" in C++. This course is beginner-friendly, as each solution is thoroughly explained and broken down into steps, so that each algorithm is easier to learn.

### **What to Expect**

Our approach is highly practical and designed to simplify even the most complex problems. We’ll not only solve each problem but also guide you through the **reasoning process** behind the solution. This will help you not just memorize algorithms but truly **understand the logic** that can be applied to future challenges.

If you’re interested in learning how these problems can be solved in other programming languages, this course is part of a larger series where we tackle the same set of problems using Python, JavaScript, and more. Stay connected with us on social media or join our Discord community for future updates, exclusive content, and lively discussions.

### **Stay Engaged**

I encourage you to ask questions, share your insights, and actively experiment with the code. The more you engage with the problems, the more confident you’ll become. Remember, problem-solving is a skill that improves with continuous practice and persistence.

### **We’re in This Together**

I’m committed to your success and will be here to support you every step of the way. If you need clarification or help with any topic, feel free to reach out.

Let’s get started on this exciting journey and unlock your full potential as a C++ programmer!
