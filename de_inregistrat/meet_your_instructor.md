### **Course Length and Structure**

This course spans over **5 hours** of in-depth content, meticulously designed to cover each problem on the **exact 75-problem list from LeetCode**. We’ll explore various fundamental and advanced topics essential for algorithmic thinking and coding interview preparation.

Here’s a more detailed look at the curriculum:

#### **1. Array Manipulation**
   - **Two-Pointer Techniques**: Mastering problems like removing duplicates from sorted arrays and container-with-most-water.
   - **Sliding Window**: Efficiently handling problems like maximum subarray sums and substring-based challenges.
   - **Kadane’s Algorithm**: For solving maximum subarray problems with ease.

#### **2. Hashing**
   - **Hash Maps and Hash Sets**: Techniques to tackle problems like two-sum, longest substring without repeating characters, and more.
   - **Collision Handling**: How hashing helps optimize solutions in problems like group anagrams.

#### **3. Linked Lists**
   - **Reversal of Linked Lists**: Solve problems like reversing nodes in k-group.
   - **Cycle Detection**: Explore Floyd's cycle detection algorithm for problems like linked list cycle detection.
   - **Merging and Splitting**: Practice merging two sorted linked lists and handling problems related to partitioning lists.

#### **4. Dynamic Programming (DP)**
   - **Memoization and Tabulation**: Understand the difference and learn when to use each technique for problems like climbing stairs and house robber.
   - **State Transition Diagrams**: Visualize and solve problems like longest increasing subsequence and word break.

#### **5. Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees**
   - **Tree Traversal**: Learn in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal techniques for problems like binary tree maximum path sum.
   - **Inserting and Deleting Nodes**: Practice insertion and deletion operations in BSTs, and balance trees as needed.
   - **Balanced Trees and AVL Trees**: Understand how tree height and balance factor affect problem-solving.

#### **6. Graphs**
   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Solve shortest path problems in unweighted graphs, like word ladder.
   - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Use DFS for problems like detecting connected components in graphs and solving island counting problems.
   - **Topological Sorting**: Handle directed acyclic graph (DAG) problems like course schedule using topological sort.

#### **7. Backtracking**
   - **N-Queens Problem**: Understand recursive decision-making to solve the N-Queens problem and related challenges.
   - **Subsets and Permutations**: Learn how backtracking helps generate combinations, subsets, and permutations of elements efficiently.
   - **Sudoku Solver**: Tackle the classic problem of solving Sudoku using backtracking.

#### **8. Greedy Algorithms**
   - **Interval Scheduling**: Solve problems like non-overlapping intervals using greedy techniques.
   - **Activity Selection Problem**: Use greedy algorithms to select the maximum number of compatible activities.
   - **Huffman Coding**: Learn how greedy algorithms are used for optimal encoding techniques in compression problems.

#### **9. Binary Search**
   - **Classic Binary Search**: Master the binary search technique for problems like finding target elements in sorted arrays.
   - **Search Variations**: Learn binary search variants for problems like finding the smallest element in a rotated sorted array.
   - **Application in Range Queries**: Utilize binary search for range query problems and efficient searching within intervals.

### **What to Expect**

Our approach is highly practical and designed to simplify even the most complex problems. We’ll not only solve each problem but also guide you through the **reasoning process** behind the solution. This will help you not just memorize algorithms but truly **understand the logic** that can be applied to future challenges.

If you’re interested in learning how these problems can be solved in other programming languages, this course is part of a larger series where we tackle the same set of problems using Python, JavaScript, and more. Stay connected with us on social media or join our Discord community for future updates, exclusive content, and lively discussions.

### **Stay Engaged**

I encourage you to ask questions, share your insights, and actively experiment with the code. The more you engage with the problems, the more confident you’ll become. Remember, problem-solving is a skill that improves with continuous practice and persistence.

### **We’re in This Together**

I’m committed to your success and will be here to support you every step of the way. If you need clarification or help with any topic, feel free to reach out.
