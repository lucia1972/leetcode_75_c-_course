The problem involves determining the duration for the price of a stock over the past days. Specifically, for each given stock price, we need to calculate how many consecutive days (including the current day) the stock price has been less than or equal to the price on the current day.

To solve this problem efficiently, I used a stack-based algorithm, commonly known as Monotonic Stack or Next Greater Element. The stack is used to store pairs of values, where each pair contains a stock price and the corresponding duration for that price. The idea is to sequentially process each new price introduced by calling the next() function and compare it with the prices stored in the stack.

The constructor initializes the StockSpanner object. It doesn't have any specific task in this implementation, but it is necessary to allow the creation of instances of the class.

The next(int currentPrice) method is the core function that calculates the duration for the current stock price. To solve the problem efficiently, we use a stack called priceSpanStack, which stores pairs of values: the stock price and the corresponding duration for that price. At the beginning of each method call, the span (duration) is set to 1 because each day has at least a span of 1 (the day itself).

We then use a while loop to check the prices in the stack. As long as the stack is not empty and the price at the top of the stack is less than or equal to the current price, we add the duration from the stack to the current duration and pop that element from the stack. This is because that price and its associated duration are no longer relevant for subsequent calculations since the new price covers all previous days represented by that price. This process continues until either the stack becomes empty or we find a price that is greater than the current price. This step is crucial because if the price in the stack is less than or equal to the current price, then all those days should be included in the current duration.

After processing the stack and calculating the correct duration, we store the pair of the current price and its calculated duration in the stack. This allows us to use this information in subsequent calls to the next() method, thereby avoiding redundant calculations.

Finally, we return the calculated duration for the current price. Instead of iterating through all elements in the list of prices to calculate the duration—which would result in an O(n) complexity for each call—the stack allows us to calculate the duration in amortized O(1) time for each call to the next() function.

This approach significantly reduces the total execution time, especially when the next() function is called multiple times. By using a stack-based algorithm, we avoid unnecessary recalculations and reduce the problem's complexity to O(1) for each price, making the algorithm highly efficient for applications with sequential and large-scale data.

To confirm the reliability and efficiency of this approach, it’s essential to test the algorithm across various scenarios, including edge cases like continuously increasing or decreasing prices. This testing will ensure that the solution performs well in all situations, providing accurate and optimal results for the stock price span problem.
