```cpp 

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> successfulPairs(vector<int>& spells, vector<int>& potions, long long success) {
        // Sort the potions vector so we can use binary search later
        sort(potions.begin(), potions.end());

        // Initialize the response vector
        vector<int> ans;

        // We hold the size of the potions vector
        int m = potions.size();

        // Iterate through each element of the spells
        for (int& v : spells) {
            // We use lower_bound to find the first potion that, multiplied by v, is >= success 
            // success * 1.0 / v converts success to a real number to avoid division errors
             // lower_bound returns an iterator to the first element that is >= the given value
            int i = lower_bound(potions.begin(), potions.end(), success * 1.0 / v) - potions.begin();

             // The number of valid pairs is given by the number of elements from position i to the end of the potions vector
            ans.push_back(m - i);
        }

        // Return the response vector
        return ans;
    }
};

```

The function `successfulPairs()` that I have to write receives as input parameters 2 arrays with integers `vector<int>& spells` and `vector<int>& potions`, and a variable `success` which has the `long long` data type, meaning it can store large integers, larger than those that can be stored by the standard `int` type.

The array `spells` is of length `n` and `potions` is of length `m`.

An element of type `spells[i]` represents the power of the `i`th spell and `potion[j]` represents the power of the `j`th potion.

A pair of `[spells, potion]` values ​​is considered successful if the product of their powers is at least equal to the `success' value.

I need to return an array of pairs of length `n` where `pairs[i]` is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with spell `i'.

What will I do in this case? How will I solve the problem?

Since it is recommended for such a problem to use the `lower_bound` binary search in the algorithm for finding valid pairs, I will initially sort the `potions` array in ascending order.
`sort(potions.begin(), potions.end());`

As we have already discussed, binary search is an efficient search technique that requires the data to be ordered. In a sorted vector, we can quickly find the position of an element or the point where this element should be using `lower_bound` or `upper_bound`.

`lower_bound` returns an iterator to the first element that is not less than the searched value, which allows us to quickly identify the first element in `potions` that, multiplied by the current element in `spells`, is large enough to satisfy the condition `spell * potion >= success`.

`upper_bound` is another useful function from the C++ STL library which, similar to `lower_bound`, is used for searching a sorted range.


If the vector `potions` were not sorted, we would have to loop through the entire vector for each element of `spells`, checking if the condition is met, which would increase the complexity of the algorithm to `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the size of the `spells` vector and `m` is the size of the `potions` vector.

By sorting the vector `potions` and using binary search, we can reduce the complexity to `O(n log n + m log m)`. The initial sort has complexity `O(m log m)`, and for each element in `spells`, the binary search in `potions` has complexity `O(log m)`, which is much more efficient.

I continue the algorithm with the initialization of an empty array `ans` in which I will store the final results, i.e. the number of valid pairs for each element of `spells`.

I then cycle through all the elements in `spells` using a `for` loop - `for (int& v : spells) {` written again with the `range-based for loop` syntactic construction to simplify the cycle through the elements of a container.

So for each element `v` in `spells`, I use `lower_bound` to find the first position in `potions` where `potion` is large enough such that `v * potion >= success`.

I convert `success` to a real number `success * 1.0 / v` to avoid division errors.

I then find the first item in the potions that has a value greater than `value'.
`lower_bound(potions.begin(), potions.end(), value)`

And I calculate the index of this element in the vector `potions` - `potions.begin()`.

After we find the index `i`, it means that all elements from this index to the end of the vector `potions` will form valid pairs with `v`. So the number of valid pairs is `m - i`, where `m` is the size of the `potions` vector. I keep this in `ans` - `ans.push_back(m - i);`.

After looping through all the elements in `spells`, I return the vector `ans`, which contains the number of valid pairs for each element in `spells`.

In conclusion, this algorithm uses an efficient algorithm to find the pairs of spells and potions that satisfy the given condition, using sorting and binary search. Sorting the `potions` vector allows using the `lower_bound` function to quickly determine the position of the first valid potion for each spell. Looping through the `spells` array with a `range-based for loop` simplifies iteration and makes the code more concise.

This approach reduces complexity and ensures that the desired result is achieved in an efficient way, being well suited for searching and selecting problems in sorted collections.

Now it's time to validate this code and ensure it operates correctly. You're encouraged to try out your own ideas, test edge cases, and explore different implementations. This practice not only confirms the solution but also enhances your learning and problem-solving skills.
