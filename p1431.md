Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

In this problem I have a vector with `n` integer elements which represents the number of candy that each child initially 
has, and an extra value `extraCandies`. Each child gets more or less candy depending on how nice he is.

I must give each child the `extraCandies` quantity and then return `false` if the new amount of candy that the child has 
is more or equal to than the maximum amount of candy that all the children in our group initially had, and `true` otherwise.

Finally, the function must return a vector of boolean values which contains all the answers to the question "if the child 
that gets `extraCandies` at some point has at least as many candies as the nicest child in the group initially had."

A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:

1. Find the maximum value on the initial vector
2. Modify the values of the initial vector by adding `extraCandies`
3. Return the final answer

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Find the maximum value on the initial vector:

In this first step, I am determining who the nicest child in the group is, and that is found by who has the most candy.


```cpp
int valMax = *max_element(candies.begin(),candies.end());
```

For this step, I am declaring a new variable `valMax` of type integer.

I used the function `*max_element (first_index, last_index);` to determine the maximum value of the vector by starting on position `first_index` to `last_index`.

The function `max_element (first_index, last_index);` returns a pointer (memory address) at which my max-value element 
is hosted. For this I am using `*`. It's a specific C++ syntax. I would do the same if I wanted the minimum element in the vector.

2. Modify the values of the initial vector by adding `extraCandies`:

To modify the values of the initial vector by adding `extraCandies` to each element, I must go over the entire vector, 
from position `0` to the length of the initial vector, `candies.size()`. I used the `size()` function so that I can quickly 
determine the length of the given vector with its help.

For the algorithm's efficiency, besides adding `extraCandies`, I can also make the comparison with the already calculated 
`valMax` in the previous step. The answer to this comparison will be boolean and it will need to be stored on the vector 
of boolean values `result`. I already declared and prepared `result` for this step.

3. Return the final answer:

```cpp
    vector <bool> result ;
    for(int i=0;i<candies.size();i++){
	    result.push_back(candies[i] + extraCandies >= valMax);
    }
```

Returning the final answer is actually combined with the traversal of the vector, adding `extraCandies`, and comparison 
to `valMax`. Depositing the answer in the new `result` vector is done using the `push_back` function from the C++ STL library. It is used to add a new element at the end of the container. If the container doesn't have enough capacity to store 
the added element, the capacity of the container will be automatically extended to accommodate the new container. This can be simply a relocation of the existing elements in the container.

My function will finally return the vector of boolean data, `result`.

**Second Solution**

I can accomplish the previously described operations by using a more compact and modern approach, the result being the same.

```cpp
    vector <bool> result ;
    for(int c : candies){
        result.push_back(c + extraCandies >= valMax);
    }
```

The line of code `for (int c : candies)` is a form of `for` loop in C++ known as a "range-based for loop". It is used to traverse 
all the elements in a container, like a vector, an array or any other data structure that supports intervals (`range`).

For each element of type integer noted with `c` that is found in the container/vector `candies`. 

The body of the loop will be executed for each integer element denoted by `c` found in the container / vector `candies`. 
The loop continues until all elements in `candies` have been traversed.


In conclusion, to determine whether each child will have at least as many candies as the nicest child after adding `extraCandies`, 
I first calculate the initial maximum value of candies, then iterate over the `candies` vector and compare each modified 
element with this maximum value. The final result is a vector of boolean values, indicating for each child whether this condition is met. 
This efficient and direct approach ensures a clear and precise solution.
