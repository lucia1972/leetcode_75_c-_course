            int valMax = *max_element(candies.begin(),candies.end());
            vector <bool> result ;
            for(int c : candies){
                result.push_back(c+extraCandies >= valMax);

In this problem, I have `n` kids with candies. I get an array `candies`, where `candies[i]` represents how many candies the `i-th` child has. I also get an integer `extraCandies`, which is the extra number of candies that each child will get.

Let's take a look at an example.

Suppose I have 5 children in `candies`. 
- The first has 2 candies, the second has 3, the third has 5, the fourth has 1, and the fifth has 3.
- The one with the most candies is the third child with 5 candies.

Next, I give each child 3 extra candies. 
- The first child now has 5 candies, the second has 6, the third has 8, the fourth has 4, and the fifth has 6.
- I check if each child now has more candies than the third child initially had (5 candies).
- If they do, the answer is `true`; otherwise, the answer is `false`.

In C++, we can easily check this using the `max_element()` function and a `for` loop.

To solve this, I first declare a variable and a boolean array `result`. Then, I give each child the `extraCandies` value and verify if the new candy count is more than the max value. Finally, I return `result`.

First, I declare an integer variable `valMax` to hold the max value. I calculate this max value using the `max_element()` function from the `<algorithm>` library. This function takes two parameters: `first_index` and `last_index`, determining the max value in the array from the start to the end. `max_element()` returns a pointer to the max-value element, which I access using an asterisk. This syntax is specific to C++. I would use a similar approach for the minimum element using `min_element()`.

I also declare the boolean array `result`: `vector <bool> result;`.

Next, I check the values after adding `extraCandies` using a `for` loop. To be efficient, I add `extraCandies` and verify if the new amount is bigger than `valMax`, then store the boolean result in `result` all on the same line. My `for` loop iterates over each `c` in `candies` using a range-based `for` loop, which traverses all elements in a container like an array.

The loop adds `extraCandies` to `c` and checks if the new `c` is bigger than `valMax`. It then adds that answer to `result` using the `push_back` function. `push_back` comes from the `STL` library and is used to add a new element at the end of a container. If the container doesn't have enough capacity, it automatically extends to accommodate the new element, potentially relocating existing elements.

In conclusion, to see if each child will have as many candies as the child with the most candies after adding extra candies, I first find the maximum initial candy count. Then, I check each child's candy count to see if adding extra candies makes it equal to or more than the maximum. The ultimate result is a list showing `true` or `false` for each child, indicating if they meet this condition.
