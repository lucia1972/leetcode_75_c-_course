        vector<bool> kidsWithCandies(vector<int>& candies, int extraCandies) {
            int valMax = *max_element(candies.begin(),candies.end());
            vector <bool> result ;
            for(int c : candies){
                result.push_back(c+extraCandies >= valMax);
            }
        return result;
        }
};
```

In this problem, I have `n` kids with candies. I get an array `candies`, where `candies[i]` represents how many candies one `i th` child has. I also get an integer value, `extraCandies` which is the extra number of candies that each child will get.

Let's take a look at an example.  **Pauza inregistrare, schimbam pe poza cu ex**
So, let's say I have 5 children in `candies`. First one has 2 candies, second has 3, third has 5, fourth one has 1, and the fifth one has 3.
The one with the most candy is the third one. So, 5 is the max value.
Then, I give each child 3 extra candies. So the first child now has 5 candies, the second has 6, the third has 8, the fourth has 4, and the fifth has 6.
Now, I check if each child has more candies than the third child initially had. If he does, the answer is `true`. And, if he doesn't, the answer is `false`.

So, in C++, we can easily check this by using the `max_element()` function and a `for`.

If I was to describe the steps needed to solve this algorithm, I would first need to declare a variable to hold the maximum value, and the boolean vector `result`. Then, I would give each child the `extraCandies` value and verify if the new amount of candy that the child has is more than the max value which we calculated. Finally, I would return `result`.

So, first I declare an integer variable which I named `valMax`. This variable holds the max value. I calculate that max value, by using the function `max_element()` from the `<algorithm>` library. In general, this function gets 2 parameters: `first_index`, and `last_index`. So, it determines the max value of the array starting on the position of the `first_index` going to the `last_index`.
`max_element()` returns a pointer at which the max-value element is hosted. And for that, I use an asterisk. This is a specific C++ syntax. I would do a similar thing if I wanted the minimum element in the array, but by using `min_element()`.

I also declare the boolean array `result`, which in C++ is declared like this:
`vector <bool> result;` **asta areti cu mouse highlight**

My next step is to check the values after adding `extraCandies`. So, I'll use a `for` loop for this step. But, in order to be very efficient with my code, I add `extraCandies` and verify if that new amount is bigger than `valMax` then store the boolean answer of that in `result` all on the same line.
So, my `for` loop goes on each c in candies. This loop is known as a "range-based `for` loop". This type of loop traverses all the elements in a container, like an array or any oterh data structure that supports intervals.

Then, adds `extraCandies` to `c` and checks if the new `c` is bigger than `valMax`. Then, adds that answer to `result` by using the `push_back` function. 
The body of the loop will be executed for each integer element denoted by `c` found in the container / vector candies. The loop continues until all elements in candies have been traversed.

`push_back` comes from the `STL` library, and it's generally used to add a new element at the end of a container. If the container doesn't have enough capacity to store the added element, the capacity of the container will be automatically extended to accommodate the new container. This can be simply a relocation of the existing elements in the container.

In conclusion, to see if each child will have as many candies as the child with the most candies after adding extra candies, I first find the maximum initial candy count. Then, I check each child's candy count to see if adding extra candies makes it equal to or more than the maximum. The ultimate result is a list saying true or false for each child, showing if they meet this condition.
