Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

In this problem, I receive a string `s` consisting of vowels and consonants. I need to identify the vowels in the string and change their positions in the vector. The string can contain both lowercase vowels and uppercase vowels.
For `s = reTUrn`
Final answer: `"rUTern"`
So I found two vowels in the string `s`: 
--- one on position 2 - the vowel `e` and
--- one on position 4 - the vowel `U` and changed them between them.
I need to return a string answer containing the entire string with the vowels changed as required.

A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:

1. Initializing the variables
2. Iterating through the string until the `left` and `right` indices meet or exceed each other.
3. Return the final answer

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Initializing the variables:

```c++
unordered_set<char> vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'};
int left = 0;
int right = s.size() - 1;

```

In this step I declare three initial variables:
--- `unordered_set<char> vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'};` - defines an unordered set of characters containing all vowels (both lowercase and uppercase);
--- `int left = 0;` - Initializes a left pointer to the beginning of the string.
--- `int right = s.size() - 1;` - Initializes a right pointer to the end of the string.

2. Iterating through the string until the `left` and `right` indices meet or exceed each other.

```c++
while (left < right) {
            // We move the pointer `left' until we find a vowel
            
            while (left < s.size() && vowels.find(s[left]) == vowels.end()) {
                left++;
            }
           

            // We check if `left' has exceeded the length of the vector
            if (left == s.size()) {
                break;
            }
            
            // We move the pointer `right' until we find a vowel
            while (right >= 0 && vowels.find(s[right]) == vowels.end()) {
                right--;
            }

            // We reverse the found vowels
            if (left < right) { 
                swap(s[left], s[right]);
                left++;
                right--;
            }   
        }    

```

This is the main loop. I move the variable `left` to the right until I find a vowel or reach the end of the string. If `left` has reached the end of the string, I am forced out of the loop.
I then move the `right` pointer to the left until I find a vowel or reach the beginning of the string.
In the last part I reverse the found vowels.
If `left` is still smaller than `right`, it means I found two vowels that need to be reversed. I use the function `swap(char1, char2)` to reverse the vowels. This C++ function, can be used to exchange values between two variables, regardless of their type, as long as that data type allows the operation of assignment (that is, assigning a value to a variable of that type).
After reversing the vowels we need to increment `left` and decrement `right` to continue traversing the string.

3. Return the final answer:
```c++
return s;

```

After all vowels have been reversed, the method returns the modified string.

In conclusion, the `reverseVowels` function provides an efficient solution for reversing vowels in a string. Using an iterative approach and an efficient container for storing vowels, this function can handle strings of any size and provides a correct and efficient result.
