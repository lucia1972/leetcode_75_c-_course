In this problem, I have 2 strings, `str1` and `str2`. I'll say that '`str1` divides `str2`' if `str1` is formed by concatenating `str2` multiple times. I need to find the largest string `x` which divides both `str1` and `str2`.

So, if I was to solve this problem step-by-step, I would first check for cyclic concatenation, then I would calculate the greatest common divisor of string lengths, and I would ultimately return the largest common substring, my final answer.

Let's take the steps one at a time.

First, I need to check for cyclic concatenation. Cyclic concatenation is a property where two strings, when concatenated in either order, produce the same result. 

For example, if `str1 + str2` is equal to `str2 + str1`, then `str1` and `str2` have a common base substring that repeats cyclically. This means both strings can be formed by repeating this common substring. 

In C++, I can check for cyclic concatenation by using a simple `if` condition:

`if (str1 + str2 != str2 + str1) return "";`

So, if `str1+str2` is not equal to `str2+str1` return an empty string.

Next, I need to calculate the GCD of string lengths. 

To do this, I will use the `gcd()` function from the `<numeric>` library which calculates the greatest common divisor of 2 integers, and the `size()` function from the `<string>` library. 

After calculating the GCD between the 2 string sizes, I'll store the answer in the integer variable `divide`.

`int divide = gcd(str1.size(),str2.size());`

Finally, I need to return my answer, the largest common substring between `str1` and `str2`. In order to achieve this substring, I am using the `substr()` function from the `<string>` library. 

It calculates the largest common substring that is part of `str1` which starts at position 0 and has its length equal to the already-calculated GCD stored in `divide`.

`return str1.substr(0,divide);`

Now, let's look at some examples to better grasp the concept.

If `str1` is equal to `LEET` and `str2` is equal to `CODE`, then `str1 + str2` is not equal to `str2 + str1`, so the answer is an empty string.

And, if `str1` is equal to `ababab` and `str2` is equal to `abab`, then `str1+str2` is equal to `str2+str1`. Next I calculate the greatest common divisor, `gcd(6,4)` which is 2. So, the answer is the substring of `str1` from position 0 to 2, which is `"ab"`.

In summary, to solve an algorithm such as this, I check if `str1 + str2` equals `str2 + str1`. If they are not equal, I return an empty string because there is no common divisor. 

If they are equal, I find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of `str1` and `str2`. The result is the substring of `str1` from the beginning up to this GCD length. This gives me the largest string that divides both `str1` and `str2`.
