```cpp

    string reverseWords(string s) {
        vector<string> words;
        stringstream newstring(s);
        string word;
        string result;

        while (newstring >> word) {
            words.push_back(word);
        }
       
        for (int i = words.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            result += words[i];
            if (i != 0) {
                result += " ";
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};

In this problem I get a string of words, `s` and I need to return the reversed string.
The problem states that a word is a sequence of non-space characters. In `s` the words are separated by at least one space. In some cases, as in the second example, the word is separated by multiple spaces. When I return my final answer, I need to return the reversed string, without extra spaces. Any spaces at the beginning or at the end of the string will be eliminated.

if I was to solve this problem step-by-step, I would first initialize the variables, then I would separate each word and extract it. Then I add it to `result` by using the `push_back()` function. Finally, I need to construct the `result` string with the words in reverse order, which is my final answer.

So, let's take the steps one at a time.

First, I need to initialize my variables. 
I declared an array `words` which serves as a container to purge the given string `s`.
I used `stringstream` to extract the words from `s`. By using this method, my code allows for a more efficient and simple way to extract words from a string and store it in an array. After I store the words in an array, I reverse their order or perform any other operations that need to be done with the string.
`stringstream` is part of the `<sstream>` library. This helps you work with words in a string. It can change data types and insert or extract data from strings. This class can be initialized with either a string or no arguments.

The temporary variable `word` is of type string and it's used to store each word in `words`.
Also in this part of the initialization of the variables, I declared a `result` variable of type string in which I will return the final result.

Next I need to separate each word and extract it. After completing the initializations, I extract each word from the string, thus removing the existing extra spaces.
The `while` loop reads each word from the newstring stream and adds it to the `words` array. This automatically removes extra spaces between words as well as any spaces at the beginning or end of the array.
After it is cleaned of any additional spaces, the new array can be subjected to other processing, in the case of the current problem, it can be traversed from the tail to the head to be reversed.

The condition present in the `while` loop - `newstring >> word` is used to extract data from an input stream object in C++. In this context, `newstring` is a `stringstream` object, and `word` is the temporary variable in which the next word extracted from the stream will be stored.
This operation reads data from `newstring` until a delimiter is encountered, usually a whitespace or a newline.
The default delimiter for this *{>>}* operator is space, so each call will read up to the next space or the end of the string.

As in the second example, `s` equals " hello world " with whitespaces at the beginning and end of `s`. The `words` array becomes "hello world".

In my final step, I need to construct the string `result` which will contain the words in reverse order.
Then, for each word stored in the temporary variable `word` I add it at the tail of the array `words` using the predefined function `push_back()`.
To remember, `push_back(word)` is a method from the `<vector>` library which adds an element at the end of the array.

After removing all the spaces, I need to proceed to building the resulting string with the words in reverse order and rounding the final answer.
For this I go through the array `words` from the end to the beginning, that is from `words.size()-1` down to 0, and add each word to `result`.
Except for the last word where between every two words of the `result` string I add a space.
This is done using the `if` decision structure. If the variable `i` has not reached the end of the string, in each iteration of the `for` loop, add a space. This means that a space will be added after each word that was placed in `result`. When `i` reaches zero, so it reaches the end of the `words` array, this conditional instruction is no longer executed, so no blank space is added at the end of the resulting string returned in `result`.
To return to the second example, I now know that `words` is "hello world" without any additional whitespaces and `result` is "world hello".

To conclude, I discussed how I can reverse the order of words in a string using this algorithm. I presented an efficient algorithm that also takes into account the extra spaces between words or those at the ends of the string, making sure that the final result has the words separated by only one space and that there is no extra space at the end.
By using the `stringstream` class to extract the words from one string and then store them in another string, I can effectively reverse the order of the words in a string, removing the extra spaces and ensuring that the final result is correctly formed.

This method is simple, efficient and easy to understand, useful for solving similar problems.
