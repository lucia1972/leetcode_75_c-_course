Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.
In this problem I receive as input a string of words and I need to return the string with the words in reverse order.
A word is defined as a sequence of characters between two spaces. Since the problem statement specifies that the words in my string will be separated by at least one space, this means that there can be multiple spaces between words and these should be removed so that only one space remains between words. Any spaces at the beginning or at the end of the string must also be eliminated.


A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:
1. Initializing the variables
2. Extracting each word and adding it to the vector
3. Constructing the resulting string with the words in reverse order

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Initializing the variables:
In the variable initialization part I need a string vector variable to store the words extracted from the string.
I use `stringstream` to extract the words from the string. This is an efficient and simple method that allows words to be extracted from a string and stored in a vector, after which their order can be reversed or other operations can be done with the new string.
`stringstream` is a class from the C++ standard library that is part of `<sstream>`. This provides functionality for manipulating strings through a stream. It is also useful for converting between data types and for extracting and inserting data into strings. This class can be initialized with either a string or no arguments.

```cpp
        //Vector to store the words
        vector<string> words;
        //String stream to extract words from `s`
        stringstream newstring(s);
        //Temporary variable to store each extracted word.
        string word;
        //String to construct the result.
        string result;
```

The `word` temporary variable is of type string and is required to store each extracted word.
Also in this part of the initialization of the variables I need in solving this problem, I will also declare a `result' string variable in which I will return the final result.

2. Extract each word and add it to the vector:
After completing the initializations, I extract each word from the string, thus removing the existing extra spaces.
The `while` loop reads each word from the newstring stream and adds it to the `words` vector. This automatically removes extra spaces between words as well as any spaces at the beginning or end of the vector.
After it is cleaned of the additional spaces, the new vector can be subjected to other processing, in the case of the present problem, it can be traversed from the tail to the head to be reversed.

```cpp
        // Extract each word and add it to the vector
        while (newstring >> word) {
            words.push_back(word);
        }
```
The condition present in the `while' loop - ` newstring >> word' is used to extract data from an istream (input stream) object in C++. In this context, `newstring' is a `stringstream' object, and `word` is the temporary variable in which the next word extracted from the stream will be stored.
This operation reads data from `newstring` until a delimiter is encountered, usually whitespace or a newline.
The default delimiter for the `>>` operator is space, so each call will read up to the next space or the end of the string.

For `s="   a good          example     "`
`words = a good example`


3. Construct the resulting string with the words in reverse order:
Then, for each word stored in the time variable `word` it is added to the tail of the vector `words` using the predefined function `push_back`.
`push_back(word)` is a member method of the `<vector>` class that adds an element to the end of the vector.

```cpp
        // Construct the resulting string with the words in reverse order
        for (int i = words.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            result += words[i];
            if (i != 0) {
                result += " ";
            }
        }
```

For `s="   a good          example     "`
`words = a good example`
`result = example good a`

After removing all the spaces, I need to proceed to building the resulting string with the words in reverse order and rounding the final answer.
For this I go through the vector `words` from end to beginning (that is from `words.size()-1` down to 0) and add each word to `result`.
Except for the last word where between every two words of the `result` string I add a space.

This is done using the `if` decision structure. If the variable `i` has not reached the end of the string, in each iteration of the `for` loop, add a space. This means that a space will be added after each word added to `result`. When `i` reaches zero, so it reaches the end of the `words` vector, this conditional instruction is no longer executed, so no blank space is added to the end of the resulting string returned in `result`.

I discussed how I can reverse the order of words in a string using C++. I presented an efficient algorithm that also takes into account the extra spaces between words or those at the ends of the string, making sure that the final result has the words separated by only one space and that there is no extra space at the end.
By using the `stringstream` class to extract the words from one string and then store them in another string, I can effectively reverse the order of the words in a string, removing the extra spaces and ensuring that the final result is correctly formed.
This method is simple, efficient and easy to understand, useful for solving similar problems on LeetCode or other competitive coding platforms.
