In this problem, I receive an array of stock prices prices and an integer value fee representing a transaction fee that is charged for every transaction made. I can either buy or sell stocks, paying the corresponding fee for each sale. The goal is to determine the maximum profit I can achieve by completing as many transactions as I want. However, no two transactions can be carried out simultaneously.

To solve this problem, I will use a dynamic programming algorithm to maximize the profit from stock transactions while accounting for the transaction fee. I chose this approach because it allows me to break the problem down into smaller subproblems and combine their solutions to get the optimal solution for the initial problem. This approach is efficient and well-suited for optimization problems like this one.

The problem consists of maximizing profit from stock transactions over a period of time, given the constraints that I cannot perform simultaneous transactions and that I must pay a transaction fee for every sale. Because of the nature of this problem, where trading decisions depend on previous states (whether I held stocks on the previous day or not), dynamic programming is an appropriate approach.

If I initialize an integer variable `int n = prices.size();` for the size of the price vector, I can define a two-dimensional array using STL syntax: `vector<vector<int>> maxProfit(n, vector<int>(2, 0))`;

This matrix will be used to store the maximum profit on each day.

If `n == 0`, meaning there are no stocks, I will return 0 because there is no profit to calculate.

Initially:

`maxProfit[0][0] = 0;` — in the first day, without holding stocks, the profit is 0.
`maxProfit[0][1] = -prices[0];` — in the first day, holding stocks, the profit is negative and equal to the stock price on the first day.
After initializing the base conditions for day 0, we move on to calculating the maximum profit for each day using the following recurrence relations:

For not holding stocks on day i:

```cpp
maxProfit[i][0] = max(maxProfit[i-1][0], maxProfit[i-1][1] + prices[i] - fee);
```

If on day i I do not hold stocks, this can result from two situations:

Either I did not hold stocks on the previous day `maxProfit[i-1][0]`, or
I sold the stocks I held on the previous day, gaining profit from the sale `maxProfit[i-1][1] + prices[i] - fee`. In this case, I must subtract the transaction fee from the profit.
For holding stocks on day i:

```cpp
maxProfit[i][1] = max(maxProfit[i-1][1], maxProfit[i-1][0] - prices[i]);
```

If on day i I hold stocks, this can result from two situations:

Either I held them on the previous day `maxProfit[i-1][1]`, or
I bought stocks on day i, meaning I paid the stock price from the maximum profit obtained without holding stocks on the previous day `maxProfit[i-1][0] - prices[i]`.
These recurrence relations are used in a loop that goes through each day in the prices vector, starting from day 1 and going until the last day:

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    maxProfit[i][0] = max(maxProfit[i-1][0], maxProfit[i-1][1] + prices[i] - fee);
    maxProfit[i][1] = max(maxProfit[i-1][1], maxProfit[i-1][0] - prices[i]);
}
```

Through this loop, we calculate the maximum profit for each day, both for the case of not holding stocks and for holding them. Each day, the algorithm automatically decides whether it's better to buy, sell, or do nothing, depending on the maximum profit calculated from the previous day.

At the end, the maximum possible profit will be stored in `maxProfit[n-1][0]`, which is the maximum profit obtained on the last day when no stocks are held. This is the value we return:

```cpp
return maxProfit[n-1][0];
```

In the above version, we use a two-dimensional vector v to store the maximum profit for each day.

However, we can optimize the space used by this algorithm. Since each state maxProfit[i] only depends on the state `maxProfit[i-1]`, we can replace the maxProfit vector with two variables to store only the values from the previous day.

Thus, we can rewrite the main loop like this:

```cpp

int cash = 0;  // The maximum profit without holding stocks
int hold = -prices[0];  // The maximum profit while holding stocks

for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    cash = max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee);
    hold = max(hold, cash - prices[i]);
}
```

In this case, the variable cash stores the maximum profit without stocks, and hold stores the maximum profit while holding stocks. Finally, we return the value stored in cash.

Through this dynamic programming algorithm, I was able to maximize the profit from stock transactions, taking into account the transaction fee and the constraint of not performing simultaneous transactions. The algorithm is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) and, with space optimization, can run in O(1) space.

This approach demonstrates the power of dynamic programming in solving optimization problems, providing a clear and efficient solution to the problem of maximizing profit from stock transactions. It's important to understand how the problem was broken down into smaller subproblems and how the recurrence relations were used to build the final solution.
