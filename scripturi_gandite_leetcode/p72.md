We are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. The allowed operations are:

--- Insert a new character,
--- Delete a character,
--- Replace a character.

The task is to return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` into `word2`.

Approach:
To solve this problem, we use a dynamic programming approach. 
The idea is to break the problem down into smaller subproblems and solve them iteratively using a 2D matrix, which will store the minimum number of operations required to convert different prefixes of `word1` into prefixes of `word2`.

Dynamic Programming Strategy:
We define a 2D matrix, `operationMatrix`, where each element `operationMatrix[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations required to convert the first `i` characters of `word1` into the first `j` characters of `word2`.

Initialization:
If one of the strings is empty, we can only perform insertions or deletions:
`operationMatrix[i][0]`: Represents converting the first `i` characters of `word1` into an empty string. 
The only option is to delete all characters from `word1`, so the value should be `i`.

`operationMatrix[0][j]`: Represents converting an empty string into the first `j` characters of `word2`.
The only option is to insert all characters from `word2`, so the value should be `j`.

Filling the DP Table:
Next, we populate the matrix by considering the three possible operations at each step:

**Insert a character**: 
Inserting a character into word1 to match `word2[0..j-1]`. 
This means transforming `word1[0..i-1]` into `word2[0..j-2]` and then inserting the character from `word2[j-1]`.
The cost of this operation is `1`, and the total number of operations is `operationMatrix[i][j-1] + 1`.

**Delete a character**: 
Deleting a character from `word1`. 
This means transforming `word1[0..i-2]` into `word2[0..j-1]` and then deleting the character `word1[i-1]`. 
The cost of this operation is `1`, and the total number of operations is `operationMatrix[i-1][j] + 1`.

**Replace a character**: 
Replacing a character in `word1` to match `word2[j-1]`.
This means transforming `word1[0..i-2]` into `word2[0..j-2]` and then replacing `word1[i-1]` with `word2[j-1]`.
The cost of this operation is `1`, and the total number of operations is `operationMatrix[i-1][j-1] + 1`.

Special Case:
If `word1[i-1]` and `word2[j-1]` are the same, no operation is needed, and we simply set `operationMatrix[i][j]` equal to `operationMatrix[i-1][j-1]`.

Recurrence Relation:
```cpp
if (word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]) {
    operationMatrix[i][j] = operationMatrix[i-1][j-1];
} else {
    operationMatrix[i][j] = 1 + min({
    operationMatrix[i-1][j],    // Delete word1[i-1]
    operationMatrix[i][j-1],    // Insert word2[j-1]
    operationMatrix[i-1][j-1]   // Replace word1[i-1] with word2[j-1]
});
}
```

Example Walkthrough:
Letâ€™s take an example to better understand how this algorithm works.

Suppose `word1 = "horse"` and `word2 = "ros"`.

Initialize the DP matrix:

`operationMatrix[0][0]` represents converting the empty string into an empty string, so it's `0`.
`operationMatrix[i][0]` represents deleting all characters from `word1` to convert it into an empty string.
`operationMatrix[0][j]` represents inserting all characters of `word2` into the empty string.
The initialized DP table looks like this:
```text
0 1 2 3
1
2
3
4
5
```

Filling the table:
We now fill the table by iterating through each character of `word1` and `word2` and using the recurrence relation.

After filling the matrix, it will look something like this:

```text
0 1 2 3
1 1 2 3
2 2 1 2
3 2 2 2
4 3 3 2
5 4 4 3
```

Final Result: 
After the table is filled, the value at `operationMatrix[5][3]` contains the minimum number of operations needed to convert "horse" to "ros", which is `3`.

Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the length of `word1` and `n` is the length of `word2`. 
We compute each cell in the DP matrix.
Space Complexity: `O(m * n)` due to the 2D matrix used to store the results of subproblems.

Conclusion:
This dynamic programming solution efficiently computes the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` into `word2`. 
By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, the algorithm ensures that we find the optimal solution with a time complexity of `O(m * n)` where `m` is the length of `word1` and `n` is the length of `word2`.

The problem presents two strings, `word1` and `word2`. We are allowed to perform three operations:

--- Insert a new character
--- Delete a character
--- Replace a character
Our goal is to return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` into `word2`.

Approach:

The key idea is to build a matrix called `operationMatrix`, where each element `operationMatrix[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the prefix `word1[0..i-1]` into the prefix `word2[0..j-1]`.

We initialize the operationMatrix as follows:

`operationMatrix[i][0]` is set to `i`, because if `word2` is empty, the only solution is to delete all characters from `word1`.
`operationMatrix[0][j]` is set to `j`, because if `word1` is empty, the only solution is to insert all characters from `word2`.
Next, we fill the operationMatrix based on these rules:

If `word1[i-1]` and `word2[j-1]` are the same, no additional operation is needed to transform `word1[0..i-1]` into `word2[0..j-1]`, so `operationMatrix[i][j] = operationMatrix[i-1][j-1]`.
If the characters are different, we have three choices:
Delete the character `word1[i-1]`, which leads to transforming `word1[0..i-2]` into `word2[0..j-1]` with `operationMatrix[i-1][j]` operations, plus one for the deletion.
Insert a character into `word1` so that it matches `word2[0..j-1]`. This means transforming `word1[0..i-1]` into `word2[0..j-2]` with `operationMatrix[i][j-1]` operations, plus one for the insertion.
Replace the character `word1[i-1]` to make it identical to `word2[j-1]`, which involves transforming `word1[0..i-2]` into `word2[0..j-2]` with `operationMatrix[i-1][j-1]`operations, plus one for the replacement.
Thus, the recurrence relation is:

```cpp
operationMatrix[i][j] = 1 + min({operationMatrix[i-1][j], operationMatrix[i][j-1], operationMatrix[i-1][j-1]});
```

At the end, the element `operationMatrix[m][n]` in the `operationMatrix` will contain the minimum number of operations needed to transform `word1` into `word2`. This value is returned as the final answer.

This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(m * n)` and a space complexity of `O(m * n)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and optimal.

Now let's test this solution to make sure it works. You are encouraged to try alternative approaches as it can help improve your algorithmic thinking and your problem solving skills.
