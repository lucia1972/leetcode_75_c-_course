The problem presents two strings, `word1` and `word2`. We are allowed to perform three operations:

--- Insert a new character
--- Delete a character
--- Replace a character
Our goal is to return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` into `word2`.

Approach:
To solve this problem, we use dynamic programming.

The key idea is to build a matrix called `operationMatrix`, where each element `operationMatrix[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the prefix `word1[0..i-1]` into the prefix `word2[0..j-1]`.

We initialize the operationMatrix as follows:

`operationMatrix[i][0]` is set to `i`, because if `word2` is empty, the only solution is to delete all characters from `word1`.
`operationMatrix[0][j]` is set to `j`, because if `word1` is empty, the only solution is to insert all characters from `word2`.
Next, we fill the operationMatrix based on these rules:

If `word1[i-1]` and `word2[j-1]` are the same, no additional operation is needed to transform `word1[0..i-1]` into `word2[0..j-1]`, so `operationMatrix[i][j] = operationMatrix[i-1][j-1]`.
If the characters are different, we have three choices:
Delete the character `word1[i-1]`, which leads to transforming `word1[0..i-2]` into `word2[0..j-1]` with `operationMatrix[i-1][j]` operations, plus one for the deletion.
Insert a character into `word1` so that it matches `word2[0..j-1]`. This means transforming `word1[0..i-1]` into `word2[0..j-2]` with `operationMatrix[i][j-1]` operations, plus one for the insertion.
Replace the character `word1[i-1]` to make it identical to `word2[j-1]`, which involves transforming `word1[0..i-2]` into `word2[0..j-2]` with `operationMatrix[i-1][j-1]`operations, plus one for the replacement.
Thus, the recurrence relation is:

```cpp
operationMatrix[i][j] = 1 + min({operationMatrix[i-1][j], operationMatrix[i][j-1], operationMatrix[i-1][j-1]});
```

At the end, the element `operationMatrix[m][n]` in the `operationMatrix` will contain the minimum number of operations needed to transform `word1` into `word2`. This value is returned as the final answer.

This algorithm has a time complexity of `O(m * n)` and a space complexity of `O(m * n)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and optimal.

Now let's test this solution to make sure it works. You are encouraged to try alternative approaches as it can help improve your algorithmic thinking and your problem solving skills.
