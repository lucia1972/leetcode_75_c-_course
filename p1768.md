```cpp
 class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
    string merged;
    int maxLength = max(word1.size(), word2.size());
    
    for (int i = 0; i < maxLength; ++i) {
        if (i < word1.size()) {
            merged += word1[i];
        }
        if (i < word2.size()) {
            merged += word2[i];
        }
    }
    
    return merged;
    }
};
```
In this problem I have two strings `word1` and `word2` , and I have to join, in alternate order, the two character strings, until one of them ends.
If one of them is longer than the other, the joining of the two strings is finished and the remaining characters from the longer string are added to the end.

I need to return the `merged` string. So I'll need to write a function that returns a string.

To determine the final string obtained by concatenating the two strings I will loop through each string from first character to its end and shuffle the characters of the two strings. 

An efficient way to do this is to loop through each string using the index `i` to take the character on position i from `word1`, and then do the same for `word2` also with index `i`.
If the two initial strings have the same length, the algorithm ends. If not, I check which of the words has characters left and these are added to the end of the new string created.

To solve this problem step-by-step, I will first initialize the string `merged` and the integer variable `maxLength`. Then, I will traverse the array in order to shuffle the characters of the two strings, and I will ultimately return the final answer.

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
 Step 1: initialization

  ```cpp
  string merged;
  int maxLength = max(word1.size(), word2.size());
  ```

  I declared the string `merged` because it will constitute the final answer of the function. It will contain all the shuffled characters between `word1` and `word2`.
  Because the 2 strings don't always have the same length, I must traverse the 2 strings until the longest one ends.
  Then, I will declare the integer variable `maxLength` which will calculate the maximum value between the sizes of `word1` and `word2`. To calculate this, I am using the `size()` function from the <algorithm> library which determines the length of the string and then uses that length as an integer value.
  Also, the `max()` function from the <iostream> library is used to calculate the maximum value between 2 integer numbers. (in our case, the size of the 2 strings)

 Step 2: shuffling

  Now, I'll create the logic of the main loop for the shuffling of the strings.
  I'm using the `for` loop in which the `i` index goes from 0 to `maxLength`.
  If there are still characters in `word1` (`i<word1.size()`), I take the character on position `i` and add it to `merged`. After this `if` operation, I repeat the process for `word2`, if `word2` still has characters.
  
 Step 3: return the final answer:

Finally I will return the `merged` string.

This would be the explanation of the entire code.

In conclusion, I created a function that combines two strings `word1` and `word2` by alternating their characters. If one of the strings is longer, the remaining characters of that string are added to the end of the resulting string. The function goes through the two strings using 1 index and adds the characters in the specified order, and finally returns the combined string.
