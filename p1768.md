``` cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string merged;
        int minLength = min(word1.size(), word2.size());
        for (int i = 0; i < minLength; ++i) {
                merged = merged + word1[i] + word2[i];
        }
        return merged + word1.substr(minLength) + word2.substr(minLength);
    }
};
```

In this problem, I get 2 strings `word1` and `word2` and I need to merge the strings together by adding their letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. 
I also know that if a string is longer than the other, the remaining letter will be added at the end of the merged string.

If I was to solve this problem step-by-step, I would first declare the variables `merged` and `minLength`, I would then calculate the minimum value between the sizes of the 2 strings, then I would use a `for` loop to check if I still have letters left in the smaller word, then merge the letter on position `i` from `word1` and the letter on position `i` from `word2`. Finally, I would return the string `merged` in which I added the remaining substring from `word1` or `word2` from `minLength` to the end.

So, I first need to declare the string `merged` and the integer variable `minLength`.
`minLength` stores the answer of the `min()` function. This function is from the `<algorithm>` library, and it calculates the minimum value between 2 integers. So, I need to get the sizes of the 2 strings as integers. I can do that by using the `size()` function from the `<string>` library.

Next, I need to go over the 2 words, from position 0 to `minLength` and alternatively add the letter on position `i` from `word1` and `word2` to merged. So, overall, I have `2*minLength` characters.

The remaining letters that were not inserted in the new word, must be added at the end. So, when I return my answer, I return the string `merged` and I concatenate the remaining substring from either `word1` or `word2` at the end.

To sum-up this solution, I first checked the minimum value between the sizes of the 2 words, then I alternated the letters, and finally I returned `merged` and added any remaining letters to its end.
