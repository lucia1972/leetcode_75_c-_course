Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

In this problem I have two strings `word1` and `word2` , and I have to join, in alternate order, the two character strings, until both end.
If one of them is longer than the other, the joining of the two strings is finished and the remaining characters from the longer string are added to the end.

I need to return the merged string. So I'll need to write a function that returns a string.

To determine the final string obtained by concatenating the two strings I will loop through each string from first character to its end 
and shuffle the characters of the two strings. 

An efficient way to do this is to loop through each string using the indexes i for the first string and j for the second. 
If the two initial strings have the same length, the algorithm ends. If not, it is checked which of the words has characters 
left and these are added to the end of the new string created.

A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:

1. Initialization
1. Alternate interpolation
1. Adding remaining characters
1. Return final answer

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Initialization:

  *Propunere in loc de paragraful de mai jos
  *Daca nu intelegi ce am scris tradu cu translate

  For this operation, the two indices i and j are declared and initalized with the value of 0. The variable merged is also 
  declared in this step and it will be used to store the final answer.

  

  For this operation, I declare 2 variables `i` and `j`  with which I will go through the two strings and a string  variable 
  `merged` for the final answer. Indices i and j will be initialized to 0. 
  `int i=0, j=0;`.

2. Alternate interpolation:

  In this step, I will create the logic of the main loop for the alternative string combination.
  In this loop, the two indexes `i` and `j` will be smaller than the length of the `word1` and `word2` strings.
  In each iteration of the loop, I will add the current character from `word1` to the final merged string and I will increment the index `i` by one.
  Then I'll repeat the same thing for the current character in `word2` and increment index `j` by one.

For this modification, I will use the `string_name.size()` method from the string class. This method in C++ returns the size (length) of the string.

`while(i<word1.size() && j<word2.size()){
    merged+=word1[i];
    i++;
    merged+=word2[j];
    j++;
  }`

For example, for `word1 = "abc"` and `word2="mnp"`, `word1.size()` is 3, because the string has 3 characters, same as the string 
`word2`. In this case, the characters will be alternatively taken from `word1` and `word2` , one by one, and inserted in the final string `merged`. 

Finally, I will get the vector `merged = "ambncp"`.

If the two strings are not of equal length, I would have to move to step 3.

3. Add remaining characters:

If the two strings are not the same length, then the matching characters must be added to the result string before adding 
the extra characters that the longer string has at the end.

For `word1 ="abcdefg"` and `word2=mnp`:
Alternate interpolation: `"ambncp"`.
Add remaining characters: `ambncp`+ `defg` =`"ambncpdefg"`.
So: if `word1 ="abcdefg"` and `word2=mnp` the final answer will be `"ambncpdefg"`.

```cpp
while(i<word1.size()){
    merged+=word1[i];
    i++;
  }
  while(j<word2.size()){
    merged+=word2[j];
    j++;
  }  
```



When I leave the main loop for alternative combination of characters, indices `i` and `j` have a value equal to the common 
number of characters of the two strings. I will continue adding the remaining characters from `word1` until the length of 
the first string is reached and then adding the characters from the second string until it ends.

For this I will also use two while loops, one for `word1` and the other for `word2`.

Finally I will return the `merged` string.

This would be the explanation of the entire code.

If I run the code for the cases of given input data I can see the results returned by my function.

For example if my input data is `"abc"` the answer will be false, for input data `"pqr"` the answer will also be `"apbqcr"` and for 
the string `"abcd"` and `"pq"`the answer will be `"apbqcd"`.

In conclusion, I created a function that combines two strings word1 and word2 by alternating their characters. If one of the 
strings is longer, the remaining characters of that string are added to the end of the resulting string. The function goes through 
the two strings using two indices and adds the characters in the specified order, and finally returns the combined string.

See you in the next video.
