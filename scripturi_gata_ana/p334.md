            if (n <= min1)
                min1 = n;
            else

In this problem, I need to determine if there exists a triple of indices `(i, j, k)` in an integer array `nums` such that `i is smaller than j smaller than k` and `nums[i] is smaller than nums[j] smaller than nums[k]`. If such indices exist, I should return `true`. Otherwise, I should return `false`.

To solve this problem, I need to find three numbers in a specific increasing order within the array. This means that for any three indices `i`, `j`, and `k`, the values at these indices must be in strictly increasing order: `nums[i] is smaller than nums[j] smaller than nums[k]`, and the indices themselves must follow `i smaller than j smaller than k`.

For example, consider the array `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
- Here, I can see that for `i = 0`, `j = 1`, and `k = 2`, I have `nums[0] = 1`, `nums[1] = 2`, and `nums[2] = 3`, which satisfies both `i smaller than j smaller than k` and `nums[i] smaller than nums[j] smaller than nums[k]`. Hence, the function should return `true`.
- I found a satisfying solution because the array is in increasing order, so the 2 rules can exist.

On the other hand, consider the array `nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`:
- In this case, no such triplet exists that satisfies the condition `i < j < k` and `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`. Thus, the function should return `false`.
- In this case, I didn't find any satisfying solution because the array is in decreasing order. I traverse the array from its head to its tail, so I'll never find 2 indeces `J` and `k` that are larger than `5`, in this case.

To solve this problem efficiently, I can use two variables, `min1` and `min2`, to keep track of the smallest and the second smallest numbers encountered so far as I iterate through the array. If I find a number greater than both `min1` and `min2`, it indicates that a triplet exists, and I can return `true`.

To describe the steps needed, I first need to initialize `min1` and `min2`, then I need to traverse each element `n` in the array `nums`, and perform operations of comparison. And finally, if no triplet was found I need to return `false`.

So, first, I need to initialzize 2 variables, that I called `min1` and `min2`. I initialize them to `INT_MAX`. `min1` is equal to the index `i`, in the problem's text, and `min2` is equal to `j`.

Next, I need to traverse each element `n` in the array `nums`. I perform 3 operations of comparison:
    - If `n` is greater than `min2`, it means we have found a valid triplet formed by `min1`, `min2`, and `n`, so return `true`.
    - If `n` is less than or equal to `min1`, update `min1` to `n` because `n` is the new smallest number.
    - If `n` is greater than `min1` but less than or equal to `min2`, update `min2` to `n` because `n` is the new second smallest number.

Finally, if no valid triplet is found by the end of the array traversal, return `false`.

To summarize, this solution effectively checks for the existence of an increasing triplet subsequence in the array `nums` using two variables `min1` and `min2` to track the smallest and the second smallest numbers encountered. By iterating through the array and updating these variables accordingly, the algorithm can determine if such a triplet exists in O(n) time complexity. If found, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
