In this problem, I need to return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the product of all the elements in the input array `nums` except for the element at index `i`.

Let's look at the details.

I am given an integer array `nums`. My task is to construct a new array `answer` such that each element `answer[i]` is the product of all elements in `nums` except for `nums[i]`. One critical requirement is that my solution must run in O(n) time complexity and I am not allowed to use the division operation.

To clarify this, let's consider an example:

Suppose I have an array `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`. The array `answer` should be such that:
- `answer[0]` is the product of `2 * 3 * 4`, which is `24`.
- `answer[1]` is the product of `1 * 3 * 4`, which is `12`.
- `answer[2]` is the product of `1 * 2 * 4`, which is `8`.
- `answer[3]` is the product of `1 * 2 * 3`, which is `6`.

Therefore, the resulting `answer` array should be `[24, 12, 8, 6]`.

To solve this problem, I can use a two-pass approach without division, maintaining an O(n) time complexity.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

First, I initialize the `answer` array with `1`s, and two integer variables, `product1` and `product2`, both set to `1`. These variables will hold the running product from the start and from the end of the `nums` array, respectively.

In the first pass, I iterate through `nums` from left to right:
- I set `answer[i]` to `product1`.
- I then update `product1` by multiplying it with `nums[i]`.

In the second pass, I iterate through `nums` from right to left:
- I multiply `answer[i]` by `product2`.
- I then update `product2` by multiplying it with `nums[i]`.

By doing this, `answer[i]` contains the product of all elements to the left of `i` after the first pass and the product of all elements to the right of `i` after the second pass.

To sum up, I solved the problem by creating an array `answer` and filling it with `1`s initially. I then used two passes over the `nums` array: the first to accumulate the product of elements to the left of each index, and the second to accumulate the product of elements to the right of each index. This approach ensures that the final `answer[i]` contains the product of all elements in `nums` except for `nums[i]`, while maintaining an O(n) time complexity and without using division.
