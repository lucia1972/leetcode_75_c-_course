In this problem, I need to return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the product of all the elements in the input array `nums` except for the element at index `i`.

Let's look at the details.

I am given an integer array `nums`. My task is to construct a new array `answer` such that each element `answer[i]` is the product of all elements in `nums` except for `nums[i]`. One critical requirement is that my solution must run in O(n) time complexity and I am not allowed to use the division operation.

To clarify this, let's consider an example:

Suppose I have an array `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`. The array `answer` should be such that:
- `answer[0]` is the product of `2 * 3 * 4`, which is `24`.
- `answer[1]` is the product of `1 * 3 * 4`, which is `12`.
- `answer[2]` is the product of `1 * 2 * 4`, which is `8`.
- `answer[3]` is the product of `1 * 2 * 3`, which is `6`.

Therefore, the resulting `answer` array should be `[24, 12, 8, 6]`.

To solve this problem, I can use a two-pass approach without division, maintaining an O(n) time complexity.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

First, I initialize the `answer` array with `1`s, and two integer variables, `product1` and `product2`, both set to `1`. These variables will hold the running product from the start and from the end of the `nums` array, respectively.

In the first pass, I iterate through `nums` from left to right:
- I set `answer[i]` to `product1`.
- I then update `product1` by multiplying it with `nums[i]`.

In the second pass, I iterate through `nums` from right to left:
- I multiply `answer[i]` by `product2`.
- I then update `product2` by multiplying it with `nums[i]`.

By doing this, `answer[i]` contains the product of all elements to the left of `i` after the first pass and the product of all elements to the right of `i` after the second pass.

To sum up, I solved the problem by creating an array `answer` and filling it with `1`s initially. I then used two passes over the `nums` array: the first to accumulate the product of elements to the left of each index, and the second to accumulate the product of elements to the right of each index. This approach ensures that the final `answer[i]` contains the product of all elements in `nums` except for `nums[i]`, while maintaining an O(n) time complexity and without using division.

The task is to return an array answer such that answer[i] is the product of all elements in the input array nums except for the element at index i. The constraints are that the solution must run in O(n) time complexity and should not use division.

Example
Consider the array nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]. The expected output array answer should be:

answer[0] = product of 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
answer[1] = product of 1 * 3 * 4 = 12
answer[2] = product of 1 * 2 * 4 = 8
answer[3] = product of 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
Thus, the resulting answer array should be [24, 12, 8, 6].

Solution Strategy
To achieve this, we use a two-pass approach without division, maintaining an O(n) time complexity.

Step-by-Step Solution
Initialization
First, we initialize the answer array with 1s, and two variables, product1 and product2, both set to 1. These variables will keep track of the running product from the beginning and the end of the nums array respectively.

First Pass: Left to Right
In the first pass, we iterate through nums from left to right:

For each index i, we set answer[i] to product1.
We then update product1 by multiplying it with nums[i].
By the end of this pass, each answer[i] contains the product of all elements to the left of i.

Second Pass: Right to Left
In the second pass, we iterate through nums from right to left:

For each index i, we multiply answer[i] by product2.
We then update product2 by multiplying it with nums[i].
By the end of this pass, each answer[i] now contains the product of all elements to the left of i (from the first pass) and the product of all elements to the right of i (from the second pass).

Explanation of the Code
Initialization:

vector<int> answer(nums.size(), 1) initializes the answer array with 1s.
int product1 = 1, product2 = 1 initializes two running product variables.
First Pass:

for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) iterates through the array from left to right.
answer[i] = product1 sets the current answer[i] to the running product.
product1 *= nums[i] updates the running product.
Second Pass:

for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) iterates through the array from right to left.
answer[i] *= product2 multiplies the current answer[i] by the running product from the end.
product2 *= nums[i] updates the running product.
Conclusion
This two-pass approach ensures that the final answer[i] contains the product of all elements in nums except for nums[i], achieving the desired outcome with O(n) time complexity and without using division. This solution efficiently utilizes extra space proportional to the input size, meeting the problem's constraints perfectly.
