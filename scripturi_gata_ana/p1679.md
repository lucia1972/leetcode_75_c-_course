In this problem, I am given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. I need to determine the maximum number of operations that can be performed on the array. Each operation involves picking two numbers from the array whose sum equals `k` and removing them from the array. This problem requires an efficient strategy to identify and remove these pairs to maximize the number of operations.

To solve this problem, I can use a two-pointer approach after sorting the array. This method efficiently finds pairs that sum up to `k` by using two pointers, one starting at the beginning of the array (`left`) and the other at the end (`right`). The two-pointer technique is particularly useful here because it allows us to systematically explore potential pairs by leveraging the sorted order of the array.

Here's how I approach the solution step-by-step:

First, I sort the array `nums` in non-decreasing order. Sorting the array allows me to use the two-pointer technique to find pairs efficiently. The sorting step is crucial as it sets up the array in a way that makes it easier to navigate and find pairs whose sum equals `k`.

Next, I initialize two pointers: `left` pointing to the start of the array and `right` pointing to the end of the array. I also initialize a variable `operations` to keep track of the number of valid operations performed. This variable will count the number of pairs we successfully identify and remove from the array.

I then iterate through the array using a `while` loop that continues as long as `left` is less than `right`. Inside the loop, I calculate the sum of the elements at the `left` and `right` pointers. This sum helps determine whether we have found a valid pair or if we need to adjust the pointers to find a pair that sums to `k`.

If the sum is equal to `k`, it means I found a valid pair. I increment the `operations` counter and move both pointers inward: `left` is incremented by one and `right` is decremented by one to continue searching for other pairs. This step ensures that we remove the identified pair from further consideration.

If the sum is less than `k`, I move the `left` pointer to the right, thereby increasing the sum in the next iteration. This is because the array is sorted, and moving the `left` pointer to the right increases the current value. This adjustment helps in finding a pair that might sum to `k`.

If the sum is greater than `k`, I move the `right` pointer to the left, thereby decreasing the sum in the next iteration. Again, due to the sorted array, moving the `right` pointer to the left decreases the current value. This adjustment helps in finding a pair that might sum to `k`.

The loop continues until all possible pairs are checked. Finally, I return the value of `operations`, which represents the maximum number of operations that can be performed on the array. This final step provides the solution to the problem by indicating how many valid pairs were found and removed.

This approach ensures that I efficiently find the maximum number of pairs that sum up to `k` with a time complexity of `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step and `O(n)` for the two-pointer traversal, resulting in an overall complexity of `O(n log n)`. The  sorting step is the most computationally intensive part, but it enables the efficient pair-finding process that follows.

To sum up, I use sorting and a two-pointer technique to find pairs whose sum equals `k`, count the number of valid operations, and return that count as the solution. By sorting the array and then using a systematic two-pointer approach, the algorithm ensures an efficient and effective solution to the problem, making it suitable for various practical applications where such pair-finding operations are needed.
