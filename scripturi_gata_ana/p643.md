In this problem, I am given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements, and an integer `k`. My task is to find a contiguous subarray of length `k` that has the maximum average value and return this value. The solution must ensure that the calculation error is less than `10^-5`.

To achieve this, I can use a sliding window technique. This approach allows me to efficiently calculate the sum of subarrays of length `k` by sliding the window across the array and updating the sum dynamically.

Here's a detailed explanation of the solution:

First, I check if the size of the array is less than `k`. If it is, I return `0.0` as it's not possible to have a subarray of length `k`.

Next, I calculate the sum of the first `k` elements. This sum represents the sum of the initial window of size `k`. I store this sum in a variable `maxSum`, which will keep track of the maximum sum encountered so far. I also use another variable `currentSum` to keep the sum of the current window as I slide through the array.

Then, I use a `for` loop to slide the window through the array starting from the `k-th` element to the end of the array. In each iteration, I update the `currentSum` by adding the next element in the array and subtracting the first element of the previous window. This way, I efficiently calculate the sum of the new window without recalculating the sum from scratch. I then check if the `currentSum` is greater than `maxSum`. If it is, I update `maxSum` to be the `currentSum`.

Finally, I calculate the maximum average value by dividing `maxSum` by `k` and return this value.

This approach ensures that I efficiently find the maximum average value of any subarray of length `k` with a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the size of the array. This is because I only traverse the array once and perform constant-time operations in each iteration.

To summarize, I use a sliding window technique to maintain and update the sum of subarrays of length `k` and track the maximum sum to find the maximum average value. The result is then returned as the maximum average value of the subarray.
