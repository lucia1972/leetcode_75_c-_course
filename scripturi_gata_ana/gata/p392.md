            if (s[i] == t[j]) {
                i++;
            }

In this problem, my goal is to see if string `s` is a subsequence of string `t`. A subsequence means you can get `s` from `t` by deleting some (or none) of its characters without changing the order of the remaining ones. This idea is really useful in many areas, like text processing, DNA sequence analysis, and more.

Understanding subsequences is essential because they keep the relative order of characters, which is often a key requirement in many algorithms and real-world problems. For instance, in DNA sequence analysis, researchers may need to identify specific gene patterns within longer DNA sequences. Similarly, in text processing, subsequences can be used to find patterns or keywords within larger texts. The ability to determine if a sequence can be extracted from another while maintaining the original order is a fundamental concept that has wide-ranging applications.

To solve this problem, I used a simple approach with two pointers in the `isSubsequence` function. First, let's look at an example to understand how this works. Suppose `s = "abc"` and `t = "ahbgdc"`. Here’s how the algorithm proceeds:

I start with both pointers, `i` and `j`, set at zero. 
Initially, I compare `s[0]` which is ('a') with `t[0]` which is also ('a'). They match, so I move `i` to 1 and keep `j` moving to the next character. 
Next, I compare `s[1]` that's ('b') with `t[1]` that's ('h'). There’s no match, so I only move `j` forward to 2. 
Then, I compare `s[1]` which is ('b') with `t[2]` which is also ('b'). They match, so I move `i` to 2 and `j` to 3. 
Afterward, I compare `s[2]` which is ('c') with `t[3]` which is ('g'). No match again, so I move `j` to 4, and then to 5 after another non-match with `t[4]` that's ('d'). 
Finally, I compare `s[2]` which is ('c') with `t[5]` which is also ('c'). They match, so I move `i` to 3.

At this point, `i` has reached the end of `s`, meaning all characters of `s` have been found in `t` in the right order. So, the function returns true.

To achieve this in C++, I set up two pointers, `i` and `j`, both starting at zero. These pointers keep track of our current positions in `s` and `t`. The idea is to loop through both strings until I either finish `s` or run out of characters in `t`. This two-pointer technique is efficient and straightforward, making it a great fit for this problem.

During each loop, I compare the characters at `s[i]` and `t[j]`. If `s[i]` matches `t[j]`, it means that `s[i]` could be part of the subsequence in `t`, so I move the pointer `i` to the next character in `s`. Whether there is a match or not, I always move the pointer `j` to the next character in `t`. This ensures that I keep scanning through `t` to find potential matches for the remaining characters in `s`.

This algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `t`. This notation means that the time it takes to run the algorithm is proportional to the sum of the lengths of both strings. In simpler terms, as the size of `s` and `t` grows, the time required to check if `s` is a subsequence of `t` increases linearly with their combined length. This makes the algorithm efficient and scalable, even for large inputs.

In summary, my approach effectively solves the problem by systematically comparing characters and moving pointers based on the rules of subsequences. This method not only addresses the immediate task but also demonstrates an efficient and straightforward way to solve string-related problems using basic programming techniques. The simplicity and efficiency of the two-pointer technique make it a valuable tool for similar challenges in different fields.

Now, let's test this code to make sure it works. Feel free to try optimizing the algorithm, as there are many ways to implement it, and different techniques can improve its performance.
