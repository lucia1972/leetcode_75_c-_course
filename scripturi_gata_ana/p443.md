In this problem, I am given an array of characters `chars` that I need to compress using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves processing consecutive repeating characters and appending them to a string `s` in a compressed format. If a character appears only once, I simply append the character to `s`. If it appears more than once, I append the character followed by its frequency count. The result is stored back in the `chars` array, and the algorithm must use only constant extra space. The final step is to return the new length of the `chars` array after compression.

First, I initialize an integer variable `poz` to zero. This variable keeps track of the position in the `chars` array where I will write the compressed result. I then start iterating through the `chars` array with an index variable `i`.

For each iteration, I capture the current character in `current_char` and initialize a counter `count` to zero. This counter will help me determine the number of consecutive appearances of `current_char`. I enter a while loop that continues as long as the current character matches `current_char` and the index `i` is within the bounds of the array. Inside this loop, I increment both `i` and `count`.

Once I exit the while loop, I write `current_char` to the `chars` array at the position `poz` and then increment `poz`. If `count` is greater than one, I convert `count` to a string and iterate through each character of this string, writing each digit to the `chars` array at the current position `poz` and incrementing `poz` for each digit.

This approach ensures that the `chars` array is modified in place, using only a constant amount of extra space as required. Finally, I return `poz`, which now represents the new length of the compressed array.

This algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `chars` array. The efficiency is important for handling potentially large arrays in practical scenarios. For instance, if `chars` represents a large text document, the algorithm can quickly compress the text without needing additional space for a separate compressed array.

To ensure clarity, consider an example to illustrate this process. Suppose `chars = ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c']`. Hereâ€™s how the algorithm would work:

--- Initialize `poz` to 0.

--- Start iterating with `i` at 0.

--- `current_char` is 'a', and `count` starts at 0.

--- Enter the while loop: increment `i` and `count` until `chars[i]` is no longer 'a'.

--- Write 'a' to `chars[poz]` and increment `poz`.

--- Convert `count` (which is 2) to a string and write each digit to `chars[poz]`, incrementing `poz`.

--- Repeat this process for 'b' and 'c'.

After processing, `chars` would be `['a', '2', 'b', '2', 'c', '3']`, and `poz` would be 6. Thus, the function returns 6.

In summary, this solution effectively compresses the `chars` array in place, maintaining constant space complexity. By counting consecutive repeating characters and writing the compressed results back to the original array, it ensures efficient and scalable compression suitable for various applications. The algorithm is robust, handling both small and large inputs effectively.
