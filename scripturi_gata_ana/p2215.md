In this problem I receive 2 arrays of numbers stored in `nums1` and `nums2` and I have to return another array consisting of only 2 elements: the first element should contain all the elements in `nums1` that are not in `nums2` and the second should contain all the elements in `nums2` that are not in `nums1`. This answer array will be named `answer`.

In order to build `answer` as quickly as possible, it's necessary to convert the 2 given arrays `nums1` and `nums2` to sets `set1` and `set2`.

Sets in C++ are STL containers of dynamically allocated data. The data retained in a set is unique and ready to be ordered, ascending or descending, because in the process of creating the data set, each element is inserted into the new structure so that it is unique and respects the ordering.

To convert arrays to sets, I will use the syntax: `set_name(name_array.begin(), name_array.end())`. Thus, I'll obtain a lot of unique values ​​ordered in ascending order. The conversion to the set of values ​​is done using the two iterators `begin()` and `end()` which dictate the exact limits between which the conversion is done.

This type of approach to the problem is classic and will be encountered in problems like:
- determining the elements of intersection, reunion and difference of two sets;
- removing duplicate elements from a set of values;
- checking if an element belongs to a set of values, etc.

Let's take a quick look at an example, so we can understand what the problem needs better.
If `nums1` equals `[1, 2, 3]`, and `nums2` equals `[2, 4, 6]`, then, the algorithm returns `answer` as `[[1, 3], [4, 6]]`. This is because the elements from `nums1` that aren't in `nums2` are 1 and 3, and the elements that are in `nums2` but not in `nums1` are 4 and 6.

I already have `nums1` and `nums2` declared as arrays, so I start off by converting these arrays to sets in order to remove duplicates and allow for set operations. I store `nums1` as a set in `set1` and `nums2` in `set2`.

Next, I initialized two arrays, `diff1` and `diff2` which will be used to store the elements that are unique to each array. `diff1` stores the unique elements of `nums1` and `diff2` stores the unique elements of `nums2`.

Now, I start iterating the arrays to find the different elements. First, I traverse `nums1` to find its unique elements compared to `nums2`. I iterate through each element in `set1` and check if it isn't present in `set2`. If it isn't, I add it to `diff1`.
I do the same for `set2`, but I store the unique elements in `diff2`.

Finally, I give my final answer as an array of 2 arrays, `diff1` and `diff2`, and return it.

In conclusion, the algorithm presented by me for this problem demonstrates the efficient use of sets to solve problems that ask to find and return the differences between two data collections. Converting arrays to sets eliminates duplicates and enables efficient search and insertion operations. This type of approach is useful in problems that require identifying unique elements, intersections, and differences between collections. The algorithm is clean and efficient, with a time complexity of `O(n + m)`, where `n` and `m` are the sizes of the two input arrays.

Let's test this algorithm to ensure it meets the problem's requirements. Feel free to optimize the code or explore alternative solutions that might be more efficient than the one provided.
