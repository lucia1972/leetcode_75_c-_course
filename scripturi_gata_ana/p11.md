In this problem, I need to find the maximum amount of water a container can store using an array `height` of length `n`. Each element in the array represents the height of a vertical line drawn at that position, with the two endpoints of the `i-th` line being `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`. The task is to identify two lines that, along with the x-axis, form a container that holds the most water. Importantly, the container must remain upright and cannot be slanted.

To solve this problem, I use a two-pointer technique. I initialize two pointers, one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the array. I also initialize a variable `max_area` to store the maximum area encountered during the iteration. My goal is to maximize the area between the lines pointed to by the two pointers.

I start by calculating the area formed by the lines at the `left` and `right` pointers. The height of the container is determined by the shorter of the two lines, as the water level cannot exceed the shorter line. The width of the container is the distance between the two pointers. Therefore, the area is calculated as the product of the height and the width. I compare this area with the current `max_area` and update `max_area` if the newly calculated area is larger.

To move towards finding the maximum possible area, I need to adjust the pointers. I move the pointer that points to the shorter line inward because moving the taller line would not increase the height of the potential new container. This adjustment increases the likelihood of finding a taller line, which might result in a larger area.

The loop continues until the `left` pointer meets the `right` pointer. By the end of the iteration, I will have checked all possible pairs of lines and found the pair that forms the container with the maximum area. The final value of `max_area` is then returned as the solution.

In summary, by initializing two pointers at the array's ends, iteratively calculating the area, updating the maximum area, and adjusting the pointers based on the shorter line, I efficiently determine the maximum amount of water the container can store. This approach ensures that I consider all potential containers without redundant calculations, resulting in an optimal solution.
