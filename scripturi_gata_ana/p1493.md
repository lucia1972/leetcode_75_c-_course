```cpp
int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
    int left = 0;
    int zero_count = 0;
    int max_length = 0;

    // Iterate over the array with the right pointer
    for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
        // If we encounter a zero, increment the zero_count
        if (nums[right] == 0) {
            zero_count++;
        }
        
        // If we have more than one zero, shrink the window from the left
        while (zero_count > 1) {
            if (nums[left] == 0) {
                zero_count--;
            }
            left++;
        }
       
        // Calculate the current window length
        int current_length = right - left + 1;
        
        // Update the maximum length (we subtract 1 to account for the required deletion)
        max_length = max(max_length, current_length - 1);
    }

    return max_length;
    }

```
In this problem, I get a binary array `nums` and I need to determine the longest sequence of `1's` in the string, if I'm allowed to remove a single `0`. I have to return an integer which represent the length of that sequence.

So, let's look at an example to better understand the idea.
If `nums` equals `[1, 1, 1]`, the answer will be 3 because there are no zeroes. 
If `nums` equals `[1, 1, 0, 1]`, the answer will be 3 again, because I can remove the `0` giving me a sequence of 3 `1's`.
And, if `nums` equals `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]`, the expected answer is 5 because I can remove the `0` on `nums[4]` which gives me a sequence of 5.

The most efficient way to solve this problem is by using the sliding window technique.

Next, the algorithm slides the window from the beginning of the array to the end. For each new position of the window, it updates the window by subtracting the element that is leaving the window and adding the element that is entering the window. I update max_length if necessary.

First, let's remember how this technique works:
--- I will consider two variables `left` and `right`. Initially both are set to position 0 of the array. They will determine the size of my sliding ​​window.
--- to expand the window, so to add new elements to the window, I will move `right` to the right.
--- I will permanently control by counting the number of null values ​​in the array in the `zero_count` variable;
--- if `zero_count` exceeds 1 (meaning there is more than one zero in the current window), I move the pointer from left to right to shrink the window until `zero_count` is at most 1.
--- in each iteration of the loop, I will calculate the window size that will also represent the length of my sequence of values ​​of `1` (in the `current_length` variable) and I will update the maximum of all these sequence lengths that I calculate, which I store in `max_length`.


So, I first need to initialize my variables. I start with `left`, `zero_count`, and `max_length`, all set to 0. 
--- `left` represents the beginning of the sliding window;
--- `zero_count` is the counter for the number of null values ​​in the array;
--- `max_length` is the maximum length of the sequence of non-zero values ​​in the array.



The `right` variable iterates over the array.
For each element at `nums[right]`, if it is zero, increment the `zero_count` variable.
If `zero_count` exceeds 1 (indicating more than one zero in the current window), we need to shrink the window from the `left` until `zero_count` is at most 1.
Move the `left` variable to the right, and if the element at `nums[left]` is zero, decrement the `zero_count`variable.
I calculate the current length of the window, i.e. `right - left + 1`.
Since I need to remove an element, the effective length of the non-null subset is `current_length - 1`.
In each iteration, I have to update the variable in which I keep the maximum length of the sequence of non-zero values ​​in the array with the maximum value between current `max_length` and `current_length - 1`.

3. The function returns returns the maximum length of the sequence of values ​​of `1`:

```cpp
    return max_length; 
```
The function returns the maximum length of the subarray containing only 1's after removing one element.

In conclusion, the algorithm uses the sliding window technique to find the maximum length of a substring of `1s` from a binary vector after removing one element. By maintaining a dynamic window and counting zeros, the algorithm ensures that each element is processed only once, providing an efficient and optimal solution with `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity.
