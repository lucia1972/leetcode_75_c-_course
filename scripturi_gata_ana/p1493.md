```cpp

    int left = 0;
    int zero_count = 0;
    int max_length = 0;

    // Iterate over the array with the right pointer
    for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
        // If we encounter a zero, increment the zero_count
        if (nums[right] == 0) {
            zero_count++;
        }
        
        // If we have more than one zero, shrink the window from the left
        while (zero_count > 1) {
            if (nums[left] == 0) {
                zero_count--;
            }
            left++;
        }
       
        // Calculate the current window length
        int current_length = right - left + 1;
        
        // Update the maximum length (we subtract 1 to account for the required deletion)
        max_length = max(max_length, current_length - 1);

In this problem, I get a binary array `nums` and I need to determine the longest sequence of `1's` in the string, if I'm allowed to remove a single `0`. I have to return an integer which represent the length of that sequence.

So, let's look at an example to better understand the idea.
If `nums` equals `[1, 1, 1]`, the answer will be 3 because there are no zeroes. 
If `nums` equals `[1, 1, 0, 1]`, the answer will be 3 again, because I can remove the `0` giving me a sequence of 3 `1's`.
And, if `nums` equals `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]`, the expected answer is 5 because I can remove the `0` on `nums[4]` which gives me a sequence of 5.

The most efficient way to solve this problem is by using the sliding window technique.

First, let's remember how this technique works:
The sliding window algorithm is an efficient technique that allows the analysis of subsequences of fixed or variable sizes from an array or string, thus reducing the complexity of the algorithm by avoiding repeated recalculation of values ​​for overlapping subsequences.

So, I first need to initialize my variables. I start with `left`, `zero_count`, and `max_length`, all set to 0. 
--- `left` represents the beginning of the sliding window;
--- `zero_count` is the counter for the number of null values ​​in the array;
--- `max_length` is the maximum length of the sequence of non-zero values ​​in the array.

Next, I declare a new variable `right` which is also set to 0, and I use this variable to traverse `nums`.
In this `for` loop, I start by checking if `nums[right]` equals 0. So, if the end of the window equals 0, then I increment `zero_count` because I found a 0.
If `zero_count` is greater than 1, that means I have more than 1 zero in the window so I have to reduce the window from the left. Meaning, `left` is increased.

In every iteration of this `for` loop, I need to calculate the size of the window. The size of the window also represents the number of elements between the left and right indeces. I store this answer in `current_length`.

Finally, I update `max_length` by calculating the maximum between the variable stored in `max_length` and `current_length - 1`. I subtract 1 from `current_length` in order to achieve the correct answer. If I didn't subtract 1, I would include the 0 that I must remove from the subsequence in my final answer. By subtracting 1, I take into consideration the so-called "clean" subsequence of 1's, without the 0 that I must remove.
This line in which I calculate the final value of `max_length` is crucial in order to achieve the final maximum length of the subsequence of `1's` that can be achieved by removing only one 0. This ensures that the algorithm follows the requirements of the problem and correctly calculates the final maximum length.

I ultimately return `max_length`.

In conclusion, the algorithm uses the sliding window technique to find the maximum length of a substring of `1s` from a binary array after removing one element. By maintaining a dynamic window and counting zeroes, the algorithm ensures that each element is processed only once, providing an efficient and optimal solution with `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity.

Now, let's test this code and then submit. Remember that you can try to solve this problem in another way that might end up being more efficient than the presented algorithm.
