In this problem I have to place flowers in a flowerbed so that the flowers are not adjacent.
For this I get an array `flowerbed` which contains only values of `0` and `1`:
--- `0` means empty place;
--- `1` means planted flower.
Also, as entry data, I have a number of flowers that should be planted, `n` so that they are not adjacent.
For two flowers to not be adjacent the array must contain three consecutive null values.

I have to return a boolean answer, namely true if I managed to plant the `n` flowers, or false otherwise.

If I was to describe the steps needed to solve this algorithm, I would first initialize the number of planted flowers, I would then traverse the array, and I would ultimately return my answer.

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
First, I need to initialize the number of flowers planted:
I will do so by declaring an integer variable `flower`, in which I will count the flowers I managed to plant. This variable is initialized to 0.

Next, I need to traverse the array. I cycle through the `flowerbed` array to check if I can plant a flower.
To loop through each position of the `flowerbed` array, I use a repeating `for` structure.

The first position of the array is position `0` and the last is `flowerbed.size()-1`, where `flowerbed.size()` determines the length of the entire array.

Also in this step, we need to determine the value of the left position and the value of the right position for each iteration.

I declared a new integer variable `left`.
If `i` is `0`, meaning I am at the beginning of the array, then `left` will be `0`. This simulates that there is no other element before the first element, so I can consider it "empty".
If `i` is not `0`, that means I am anywhere else in the array, then `left` will be set to the value of the previous element in the array, that is `flowerbed[i - 1]`.
This type of `if` condition is known as a `ternary operator` or a `conditional operator`. It's a concise way to write conditional statements. Its general form is:
`(condition) ? expression1 : expression2;`

- If the `condition` is `true`, `expression1` is evaluated.
- If the `condition` is `false`, `expression2` is evaluated.

This is a way to check if the previous place is empty or not without going outside the bounds of the array, especially for the first element.

For the right end of the array, I declared a new integer variable `right`.
If I am at the last position `i == flowerbed.size() - 1`, there is no position to the `right`, so I set `right` to `0`. 
Otherwise, `right` will be the value from the next position `(flowerbed[i + 1])`.

To check if I can plant a flower I will determine the value between the current position, the position to its left and 
the one to its right. If this amount is `0`, it means that positions adjacent to the current position are empty, so I can plant a flower in the current position.
If I can plant a flower, I will change the value of the current position from 0 to 1 and increase the value of the `flower` variable because I managed to plant a new flower.

And, finally, I need to return my answer and check if I placed all the flowers given by `n`.

Thus, I achieved an efficient and clear solution, iterating through the flowerbed only once and performing simple 
operations to determine if I can plant the number of flowers initially entered.
