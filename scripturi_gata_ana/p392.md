```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s.size() && j < t.size()) {
            if (s[i] == t[j]) {
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return i == s.size();
    }

};
```
Absolutely, let me explain how I approached solving this problem:

In this problem, I needed to determine if string `s` is a subsequence of string `t`. A subsequence means that `s` can be derived from `t` by deleting some (or none) of its characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde", but "aec" is not.

To solve this problem, I used a two-pointer technique within the `isSubsequence` function. I initialized two pointers, `i` and `j`, to zero, representing the starting positions of `s` and `t`, respectively. I then iterated through both strings using a while loop.

During each iteration:
- I checked if the current characters `s[i]` and `t[j]` are equal.
- If they match, I moved the pointer `i` forward to check the next character in `s`.
- Regardless of whether there was a match, I always moved the pointer `j` forward to continue scanning through `t`.

After completing the loop, I checked if pointer `i` had reached the end of `s`. If `i` equals `s.size()`, it indicates that `s` is indeed a subsequence of `t`, and I returned true. Otherwise, I returned false.

This approach ensures efficiency with a time complexity of O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `t`. This efficiency is crucial for handling potentially large strings in real-world scenarios.

This implementation effectively determines if `s` is a subsequence of `t` by systematically comparing characters and advancing pointers accordingly. It demonstrates an efficient approach to solving string-related problems using fundamental programming techniques.
