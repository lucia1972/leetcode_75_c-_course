In this problem, I receive an array of integers `arr`, and I need to return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not the number of occurrences of each value in `arr` is unique.

Let's take a quick look at an example.
Suppose `arr` equals `[1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3]`.
The distinct elements are: 1, 2, and 3.
When I count how many times each element appears, I notice that 1 appears 3 times, 2 appears twice, and 3 appears only once. So, no 2 values have the same number of occurrences. Which means, I return `true`.

To solve this problem efficiently, I decided to use a 2-step algorithm:
At the beginning I will count how many times each number appears in the initial array. I will keep these counters in `countMap`.
I will then check if the number of these occurrences is unique for each value.

First, I will count how many times each number appears in the initial array.

Let's start by understanding what an unordered map is.
`unordered_map<>` is an associative container from the C++ STL library that stores components characterized by:
--- `key` which is a part of the element that establishes the order in which the element is stored in the container;
--- and a `value` that's part of the element that represents the value assigned by the element with the paired key.

The key of an element is unique. In a data collection there cannot be more than one element with the same key. If an attempt is made to insert an element with an already existing key, the value associated with that key will be overwritten.
We use `unordered_map<>` because the order of the elements is not important here and we want quick access to the elements through the keys. If we needed an ordered collection, we could use `map<>`.

Elements in `unordered_map<>` are not stored in a specific order. The order in which the elements are accessed can vary and does not follow the order of insertion.

Using this library is very efficient for situations where we need to search or insert elements quickly based on a key.

It is ideal for implementing data structures such as dictionaries, symbol tables and others that require fast lookups, being a very powerful and efficient container for managing key-value pairs in C++, providing excellent performance for most common operations due to its hash table-based implementation.

In the case of the current problem, `countMap` has keys of type `int` and values ​​of type `int`.
The `for` loop is a range-based `for` loop that iterates through each `num` element in the `arr` array. This type of loop simplifies iterating through the elements of a collection, such as arrays, lists, matrices, etc., because it provides a more concise and readable syntax compared to the traditional `for` loop.
For each element with the key `num` in `arr`, the value associated with the key `num` in `countMap` is incremented.
If `num` does not already exist in `countMap`, a new entry will be created with an initial value of 0, which will then be incremented to 1.

As an example, let's consider that `arr` equals `[-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]`.
First, I traverse the array. In `countMap`, I count how many times each element appears when I traverse `arr`. So, I first take `-3` and say in `countMap` that it appeared once, so far.
`countMap = {-3:1}`

The next element in `arr` is 0, and I count that in `countMap`. So, I say -3 appears once and 0 appears once.
`countMap = {-3:1,0:1}`

Then, the next element is 1. I count that too. So far, I know that -3, 0 and 1, all appear only once.
`countMap = {-3:1,0:1,1:1}`

Afterward, I encounter another -3. So, in `countMap` the number of appearances of -3 goes up by 1.
`countMap = {-3:2,0:1,1:1}`

Then, I encounter another 1, and another one on the next position, and another 1 on the position after that. So after performing the algorithm for each one, `countMap` ends up with 4. So, for the first 1 encountered, `countMap` is at 2, then, for the next 1 it becomes 3, and finally, it becomes 4.

Next, I find a 10. I now say in `countMap` that -3 appeared 3 times, 0 appeared once, 1 appeared 4 times and 10 appeared once.
And, on the final position I find another 0. So, my final answer is that -3 appeared 3 times, 0 appeared twice, 1 appeared 4 times, and 10 appeared once.
`countMap = {-3:3,0:2,1:4,10:1}`.

So, now that I determined `countMap` I can move on to the next step.

I now need to check if the occurrences are unique. To do that, I use an unordered set to check if the number of occurrences of each element in `arr` is unique.
Why do I need this data structure?
An `unordered_set<>` allows me to store distinct values ​​and efficiently check if a value has already been added to the set.

In the case of this problem, I want to check if the number of occurrences of each element in `arr` is unique. If I encounter the same number of occurrences twice, it means that the occurrence numbers are not unique and I will return the answer `false`.
The search operation I need, in `unordered_set<>` has `O(1)` time complexity, which makes the verification fast.
Compared to other data structures, for example, an array or a list, `unordered_set<>` provides a more efficient verification for the presence of a value in the set being searched.

Using the `for` loop, I go through all the pairs (key, value) in `countMap`.
Since `countMap` is an `unordered_map<>` that stores each element in the array and its occurrence count, I will use `auto& entry` which is a reference to each (key, value) pair in `countMap`.

Then, using the statement `if (uniqueSet.find(entry.second) != uniqueSet.end()) {` I check if this number of occurrences (`entry.second`) already exists in uniqueSet.
`entry.first` is the number in the array, and `entry.second` is the number of occurrences of an element in the countMap.
Search for `entry.second` in `uniqueSet` using `uniqueSet.find(entry.second)`.
If `entry.second` is found in `uniqueSet`, meaning if the expression `(uniqueSet.find(entry.second) != uniqueSet.end())` is `true`, it means that this number of occurrences is not unique and so I return `false`.
If the above expression is not true, so I do not return `false`, it means that I have uniqueness and using `uniqueSet.insert(entry.second);`' I insert `entrySecond` into `uniqueSet`.
This way, I make sure that the following iterations will check the uniqueness of the number of occurrences with all the numbers of occurrences encountered previously.

Finally, I return `true`.
If we did not return `false` at all, it means that the final answer is `true`, meaning there are no duplicates in the number of occurrences.

In conclusion, to solve this problem, I used an efficient approach based on two C++ data structures: `unordered_map<>` and `unordered_set<>`.

--- `unordered_map<>` allowed me to quickly and efficiently count the occurrences of each element in the array.
--- `unordered_set<>` helped me check that these occurrence numbers are unique, making sure there are no duplicates.

By traversing the array to build the map of occurrences and then checking for their uniqueness in a set, my algorithm works in linear time with respect to the size of the array, thus providing an optimal and clear solution.

This algorithm can be used to solve similar problems involving counting and checking the uniqueness of elements in a collection, demonstrating the utility and power of these data structures in the C++ STL library.

Now, let's put this algorithm to the test and ensure it meets the problem's requirements. Keep in mind that you are welcome to optimize this code or explore alternative solutions that might prove more efficient than the one presented.
