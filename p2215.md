Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

In this problem I receive 2 strings of numbers stored in `nums1` and `nums2` and I have to return another vector consisting of only 2 elements: the first element should contain all the elements in `nums1` that are not in `nums2` and the second to contain all the elements in `nums2` that are not in `nums1`. This answer vector will be `answer`.

In order to create as quickly as possible the vector `answer` that contains the differences between the two initial vectors, it is necessary to convert the two vectors `nums1` and `nums2` to sets `set1` and `set2`.

Sets in C++ are STL containers of dynamically allocated data. The data retained in a set are unique and ready to be ordered (ascending or descending) because in the process of creating the data set, each element is inserted into the new structure so that it is unique and respects the ordering.
To convert vectors to sets, I will use the syntax: `set_name(name_array.begin(), name_array.end())` and will thus obtain a lot of unique values ​​ordered in ascending order. The conversion to the set of values ​​is done using the two iterators `begin()` and `end()` which dictate the exact limits between which the conversion is done.

This type of approach to the problem is classic and will be encountered in problems of the type:
- determining the elements of intersection, meeting and difference of two sets;
- removing duplicate elements from a lot of values;
- belonging of a given element to many values, etc.

For `nums1 = [1,2,3]` and `nums2 = [2,4,6]` the algorithm will return `answer =[[1,3],[4,6]]` because `[1,3]` are the elements from `nums1` that are not in `nums2` and `[4,6]` are the elements from `nums2` that do not exist in `nums1`.

For `nums1 = [1,2,3,3]` and `nums2 = [1,1,2,2]` the algorithm will return `answer =[[3],[]` because `[3]` are the element from `nums1` that are not in `nums2` and all the elements from `nums2` that exist in `nums1`.

A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:

1. Convert the input vectors to sets to remove duplicates and allow for set operations.
2. Create result vectors for the differences.
3. Find elements in `set1` that are not in `set2`.
4. Find elements in `set2` that are not in `set1`.
5. Prepare the final answer.


So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Convert the input vectors to sets to remove duplicates and allow for set operations:

```cpp
        unordered_set<int> set1(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
        unordered_set<int> set2(nums2.begin(), nums2.end());
```
I convert `nums1` and `nums2` into sets (`set1` and `set2` respectively) to ensure that each element is unique and to allow for efficient set operations.

2. Create result vectors for the differences:

```cpp
        vector<int> diff1, diff2;
```
`diff1` is the vector that will collect the elements from `set1` that are not in `set2`.
`diff2` is the vector that will collect the elements from `set2` that are not in `set1`.

3. Find elements in `set1` that are not in `set2`:

```cpp
        for (int num : set1) {
            if (set2.find(num) == set2.end()) {
                diff1.push_back(num);
            }
        }
```

I iterate through each element in `set1` and check if it is not present in `set2`. If it is not, I add it to `diff1`.


4. Find elements in `set2` that are not in `set1`:

```cpp
        for (int num : set2) {
            if (set1.find(num) == set1.end()) {
                diff2.push_back(num);
            }
        }
```
Similarly, I iterate through each element in `set2` and check if it is not present in `set1`. If it is not, we add it to `diff2`.

5. Prepare the final answer:

```cpp
        vector<vector<int>> answer = {diff1, diff2};
        return answer;
```

I prepare the final answer as a vector of two vectors (`diff1` and `diff2`) and return it.

In conclusion, the algorithm presented by me for this problem demonstrates the efficient use of sets to solve problems of the type of differences between two data collections. Converting vectors to sets eliminates duplicates and enables efficient search and insertion operations. This type of approach is useful in problems that require identifying unique elements, intersections, and differences between collections. The algorithm is clean and efficient, with a time complexity of `O(n + m)`, where `n` and `m` are the sizes of the two input vectors.
