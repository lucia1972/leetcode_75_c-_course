Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

In this problem, I am asked to determine the maximum average value of a substring of numbers of given length `k`, from a string of integers given initially in the vector `nums`.
For this I chose to use the "sliding window technique".
The "sliding window technique" is an efficient way to solve problems involving finding a substring that satisfies certain conditions. This technique is especially useful when you need to process or examine a subset of contiguous elements in an array or string.
By "sliding the window" I can maintain and update the information needed to solve the problem efficiently without having to process the same elements repeatedly.


The "sliding window technique" could be explained as follows:
--- The initial "window" represents a substring of elements starting from position `0` of length k;
--- in the case of the present problem, we calculate the sum of the elements in this "window" and assume that it is the maximum sum;
--- we then move the window one element at a time and update the sum as the window slides, adding the new element that enters the `nums[i]` window and removing the element that leaves the `nums[i-k]` window;
--- in each iteration we update the maximum amount because that is ultimately the requirement of the problem.

A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:
1. Calculate the sum of the first k elements. This will be our initial window sum.
2. Slide the window from the beginning to the end of the array. For each new position of the window, update the window sum by subtracting the element that is leaving the window and adding the element that is entering the window. Keep track of the maximum window sum encountered.
3. Compute the average value of the maximum window sum by dividing it by `k` and return it.


So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Calculate the sum of the first k elements. This will be our initial window sum:

Initially, I need to check if the size of the vector determined with `nums.size()` is greater than `k`. If this condition is not met, I cannot find a substring of length `k`. The algorithm returns the double value `0,0`.

```cpp
        if (nums.size() < k) return 0.0;

        // Calculate the sum of the first window
        double maxSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            maxSum += nums[i];
        }
        
        double currentSum = maxSum;
```

The initial sum of the first `k` elements, is calculated and stored in `maxSum` and `currentSum`, 2 double variables.
The requirement of the problem is that the `findMaxAverage` function returns a `double` answer.
In C++, `double` is a data type used to represent floating-point numbers with double precision. It is one of the basic built-in types in the language and is used for storing and manipulating numbers that have a fractional part. The double data type offers higher precision compared to the float data type.

2. Slide the window from the beginning to the end of the array. For each new position of the window, update the window sum by subtracting the element that is leaving the window and adding the element that is entering the window. Keep track of the maximum window sum encountered:

```cpp
    for (int i = k; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        currentSum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
        if (currentSum > maxSum) {
            maxSum = currentSum;
        }
    }
```

When we left the `for` loop from the previous step, the first `k` elements were already summed.
Now I am at position `k` in the vector.
I go through the vector until the end and do 2 operations in each iteration:
--- slide the "window" by adding the next element that enters the `nums[i]` window and removing the element that leaves the `nums[i-k]` window;
--- determine the new maximum amount in the `maxSum` variable.

3. Compute the average value of the maximum window sum by dividing it by `k` and return it:

```cpp
    // Return the maximum average value
        return maxSum / k;
```

After processing all possible windows, the maximum sum is divided by k to get the maximum average value.

In concusion, the "sliding window technique" reduces the time complexity significantly compared to brute force methods. Instead of recalculating sums or other values for each subarray, I update the values efficiently by maintaining a running total.
The code is often simpler and easier to understand compared to more complex approaches like dynamic programming.
The "sliding window technique" is a powerful tool in the arsenal of algorithms, especially for problems involving subarrays or substrings.
