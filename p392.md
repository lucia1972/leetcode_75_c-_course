Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

In this problem, I need to check whether a string `s` is a subsequence of another string `t`.
A subsequence is defined as a sequence derived from another string by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining ones.

The solution I propose is to go through the 2 strings in parallel to check if all the characters of `s` appear in `t`.

A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:
1. Initialization of variables
2. Traversal of the vector `t` and comparison of the characters
3. Return the number of pairs of numbers that I was able to remove from the vector.

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Initialization of variables:

```cpp    
    int i = 0, j = 0;   
    }
```

I need two variables `i` and `j`:
--- the variable`i` is required to traverse vector `s`;
--- the variable `j` is required to traverse the vector `t`.

2. Traversal of the vector `t` and compare the characters:

```cpp
    while (i < s.size() && j < t.size()) {
        // We check if the current character in s coincides with the current character in t
        if (s[i] == t[j]) {
            // Dacă coincid, avansăm la următorul caracter din s
            i++;
        }
        // Regardless of whether the characters match or not, we advance to the next character in t
        j++;
    }        
```

We use a `while` loop to loop through the string `t` until we have found all the characters in `s` (`i < s.size()`) or to the end of it (`j < t.size()`) .

At each iteration, I check if the current character in `s` (`s[i]`) matches the current character in `t` (`t[j]`).
If they match, I increment the variable `i` to move to the next character in `s`.
In any situation, regardless of whether the characters coincide or not, I need to increment the `j` variable to move to the next character in `t`.

3. Return the numbers of pairs of numbers that I was able to remove from the vector:

```cpp    
    return i == s.size();
   
```
After the end of the `while` loop, I check if the value of `i` coincides with `s.size()`, so if I have reached the end of the string `s`.
If so, it means that all characters in `s` were found in `t` in the same order. In this case I return `true`.
Otherwise, I return `false`.

In conclusion, this algorithm uses linear traversal of the string `t` to check whether the characters in `s` form a subsequence of it. I used an efficient method of parallel traversal of the two strings together with character comparison.
