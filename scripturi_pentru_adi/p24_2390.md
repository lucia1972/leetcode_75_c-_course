Hello and welcome to our Algorithmic course, where we will explore and solve interesting problems on LeetCode.

In that problem, I receive a string of characters that contains letters from the English alphabet and the character `*`.
When traversing the array, I need to remove the last non-star character that occurs when I encounter a `*` character, a stack is suitable for this problem.
If the current character is `*`, we remove the last element before it.
There is a guarantee that we can always perform the eliminations because there is always at least one regular character to the left of every `*` character.
After we remove all the `*` characters and their neighboring characters, I will end up with a single string. This means that no matter how we remove the `*` characters, I will always get the same result. So the uniqueness property of the algorithm is ensured.

For `s = "leet**cod*e"`
`c = 'l'`
The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack.
Stack: ['l']

`c = 'e'`
The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack.
Stack: ['l', 'e']

`c = 'e'`
The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack.
Stack: ['l', 'e', ​​'e']

`c = 't'`
The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack.
Stack: ['l', 'e', ​​'e', ​​'t']

`c = '*'`
The character is `*` so we pop (pop) the last character added to the stack.
Stack: ['l', 'e', ​​'e']

`c = '*'`
The character is `*`, so we pop (pop) the last character added to the stack.
Stack: ['l', 'e']

`c = 'c'`
The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack.
Stack: ['l', 'e', ​​'c']

`c = 'o'`
The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack.
Stack: ['l', 'e', ​​'c', 'o']

`c = 'd'`
The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack.
Stack: ['l', 'e', ​​'c', 'o', 'd']

`c = '*'`
The character is `*`, so we pop (pop) the last character added to the stack.
Stack: ['l', 'e', ​​'c', 'o']

`c = 'e'`
The character is not `*`, so it is added to the stack.
Stack: ['l', 'e', ​​'c', 'o', 'e']

The most natural solution for this problem involves using the `stack` structure.
A `stack` is a data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, meaning the last element added to the `stack` will be the first to be removed. In C++, the `stack` is implemented using the `stack` container from the STL (Standard Template Library).
This time, the `stack` is useful to handle discarding previous characters when we encounter a `*` character. Thus, the last character added is always the first to be removed, which perfectly matches the requirements of the problem.
If we use a `stack`, the management of successive removals of characters and reduces the complexity of the logic required to keep the correct order of the remaining characters will be greatly simplified.

A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:

1. Initialization of variables.
2. Traversing each character in the string.
3. Constructs the resulting string from the stack
4. Return the final answer by inverting the array.

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Initialization of variables:

```cpp
    stack<char> st;
```
The variable `st` is an empty stack prepared to receive characters from the string `s`.

2. Traversing each character in the string:

```cpp
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '*') {
            if (!st.empty()) {
                st.pop();
            }
        } else {
            st.push(c);
        }
    }
```
Traversal of the string `s`is done using a repetitive `for` loop.
For each character `c` in the string `s`, i.e. `for(char c : s)` I decide what to do with the character `*` and what to do with a letter character.
If the character is `*` (`c == '*'`) the check code will be executed if the stack is empty.
I perform this step using an `if` structure and the condition is `!st.empty`, that is, I check if the stack is not empty. This syntax returns `true` if the stack contains elements and `false` if it is empty.
If the stack contains elements, i.e. the answer returned by the condition is `true`, then using the `pop()` function known from stack operations, I can remove an element from the top of the stack (the newest or the top of stack). This is a built-in function of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) that belongs to the `<stack>` header file. The element is removed from the stack container and the stack size is reduced by 1.
Otherwise, that is, if the answer is `false`, it means that `c` is not `*`, so it will have to be added to the top of the stack. For this I will use the `push()` function. This function is a built-in function of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and also belongs to the `<stack>` header file. With its help, similar to arrays, I can "push" / add an element to the top of the stack. The element is added to the stack container and the stack size is increased by 1.
In conclusion, in this step, going through the entire string `s`, I build in the empty stack `st` a new set of values ​​that corresponds to the requirements of the problem, i.e. for each character in the string `s`:
--- if character is `*`, remove the last character added to the stack (if the stack is not empty).
--- if the character is not `*`, I add it to the stack.
All I have to do is create the final result and return it.

3. Constructs the resulting string from the stack:

```cpp
    string result;
    while (!st.empty()) {
        result += st.top();
        st.pop();
    }
```

To build the result, I need a string variable that I will name `result'.
I will go through the entire stack, as long as there are still elements in the stack. I can do this efficiently with a `while` loop, more precisely `while(!st.empty())`. If the stack ends up being empty, the condition will return `false` and the repetitive `while` loop will stop.
To get the element from the top of the stack, I have another STL function handy, the `pop()` function. This returns the element from the top of the stack without removing it. This element is added to the end of the result string using the `+=` operator.
After adding the current element to `result`, it must be removed from the top of the stack to access the next element. For this, I use the `pop()` function again, i.e. `st.pop()`.
The stack works according to the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, so elements are added to the result in the reverse order in which they were inserted into the stack.

For the stack built in the previous example, if its elements are `['l', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'e']` in this order, having element `e` at the top of the stack, the `while` loop will perform the following iterations:

First iteration:
`st.top()` returns `e`.
`result += 'e'` adds `e` to result, so result becomes "e".
`st.pop()` pops `e` off the stack.
Stack: `['l', 'e', ​​'c', 'o']`

Second iteration:
`st.top() `returns `o`.
`result += 'o'` adds `o` to result, so result becomes "eo".
`st.pop()` pops `o` off the stack.
Stack: `['l', 'e', ​​'c']`

Third iteration:
`st.top()` returns `c`.
`result += 'c'` adds `c` to result, so result becomes "eoc".
`st.pop()` pops `c` off the stack.
Stack: `['l', 'e']`

Fourth iteration:
`st.top()` returns `e`.
`result += 'e'` adds `e` to result, so result becomes "eoce".
`st.pop()` pops `e` off the stack.
Stack: `['l']`

Fifth iteration:
`st.top()` returns `l`.
`result += 'l'` adds `l` to result, so result becomes "eocel".
`st.pop()` pops `l` off the stack.
Stack: `[]` so the stack is empty and the loop will stop.

4. Return the final answer by inverting the array:

After the `while` loop terminates, result contains the string consisting of all the characters on the stack in the reverse order in which they were originally added. At this point, the `result` is "eocel". To get the string in the correct order, there is a string reversal step:

```cpp
    // Since stack pops elements in reverse order, we need to reverse the result string
    reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
    return result;
```
After inversion, result becomes "lecoe", which is the correct final string after removing all characters preceded by `*` from the original string `s`.
Function `reverse(result.begin(), result.end());` is a function in the STL's `<algorithm>` library that reverses the order of elements in a collection. Here we used it to reverse the order of the elements in the `result` string.
Specifically, `result.begin()` returns an iterator to the first element of the `result` string, `result.end()` returns an iterator to the position after the last element of the `result` string so that in final, `reverse(result.begin(), result. end())` to take these two iterators and reverse all elements between them (including the first element and excluding the position after the last element).
Function `reverse(result.begin(), result.end());` is essential to transform the `result` string, which contains the characters in reverse order from the desired order, into the correct order. Without this inversion, the `result` string would not correctly reflect the original string processed as required by the problem.

In conclusion, we included the stack in this algorithm to efficiently manage the successive deletions of characters from the initial string. Using it considerably simplified the necessary logic and maintaining the remaining characters in a correct order. In the end, I obtained a `result` string with the final characters that only had to be reversed to constitute the final answer to the problem. It is a simple method, because the notion of `stack` in C++ comes with some extremely productive functions that I also used in the realization of this algorithm.
