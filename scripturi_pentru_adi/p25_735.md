In this problem I have a series of asteroids that can collide with each other.
Array integer `asteroids` is a collection of integer values ​​that represent the size / magnitude of the asteroid together with their direction of movement (represented by the sign) - if the number is negative, the asteroid moves to the left, otherwise it moves to the right. All asteroids move at the same speed.
If the asteroids have the same sign, it means that they go in the same direction, so they will not collide.
If 2 asteroids with different magnitudes collide, i.e. they move in different directions, the smaller one explodes.
If 2 asteroids with the same magnitude but different signs collide, they will both explode.
I need to determine the state of the asteroids after all the collisions.

To better understand what the solution algorithm should include, it would be better to take a particular case and see what happens with each asteroid separately.

For `asteroids = [5,10,-5,8,-8,9,6,-4,-3]`

`5` is positive → `stackResponse = [5]`.
`10` is positive → `stackResponse = [5, 10]`.
`-5` is negative:
`10` is positive and greater than `-5` → stackResponse remains unchanged.
`8` is positive → `stackResponse = [5, 10, 8]`.
`-8 `is negative:
`8 `is positive and equal to `-8` → both are removed → `stackResponse = [5, 10]`.
`9` is positive → `stackResponse = [5, 10, 9]`.
`6` is positive → `stackResponse = [5, 10, 9, 6]`.
`-4` is negative:
`6` is positive and greater than `-4` → `stackResponse` remains unchanged.
`-3` is negative:
`6` is positive and greater than `-3` → `stackResponse` remains unchanged.

Final result: `stackResponse = [5, 10, 9, 6]`.


The best way to implement this code is to use a `stack`.
This type of data structure is a linear structure that follows LIFO (Last In First Out),
which inserts a new element and removes an element that already exists at the top of the stack. The elements of a stack can only be accessed from the top, from the top of the stack.

A step-by-step approach to solve this problem is:

1. Initialization of variables.
2. Traversing each asteroid in the array.
3. Management of positive asteroids.
4. Managing of negative asteroids.
5. Converting the stack into an array to be returned as the final result
6. Return the final answer.

So, let's take the steps one at a time.
1. Initialization of variables:

```cpp
    stack<int> stackResponse;
```

I will initialize a `stackResponse` stack that will be used to store the remaining asteroids after all collisions.

2. Traversing each asteroid in the array:
```cpp
    for (int a : asteroids) {
```

For each asteroid `a` in the series of asteroids I will do the subsequent operations contained in this `for` loop. The search operations for the asteroids that remain until the end in the array are fully enclosed between the curly braces of this repetitive `for` structure.

3. Management of positive asteroids:

```cpp
    for (int a : asteroids) {
        if (a > 0) {
            stackResponse.push_back(a);
        } 
```

If the current asteroid `a` is a positive asteroid (moving to the right), it will be added directly to the `stackResponse` because it cannot collide with any asteroid already in the array.

4. Managing of negative asteroids:
```cpp
    while (!stackResponse.empty() && stackResponse.top() > 0 && stackResponse.top() < -a) {
        stackResponse.pop();
    }
    if (!stackResponse.empty() && stackResponse.top() == -a) {
        stackResponse.pop();
    } else if (stackResponse.empty() || stackResponse.top() < 0) {
        stackResponse.push(a);
    }
```

In the first part of this code fragment, the asteroids at the top of the stack are removed if the stack is not empty, the element at the top is positive and it also has a magnitude smaller than `-a`.
As long as the stack is not empty `!stackResponse.empty` (it is equivalent to `stackResponse.size()`) and also the element at the top in the stack has positive magnitude `stackResponse.top() > 0` that is it moves to the right, and smaller than the magnitude to the negative asteroid `-a`, `stackResponse.top()< -a`, then the positive asteroid in the `stackResponse.pop()` stack is destroyed by the negative asteroid `a`, so it is removed from the stack using the `pop()` method.
If one of the conditions of this loop is not fulfilled, the loop `while` is abandoned.
Using the `pop()` method in this context it is used to remove the element from the top of the stack which implies reducing the size of the stack by one element.

The second part of this code snippet handles collisions between negative asteroids and those in the `stackResponse` stack.
If the stack is not empty `!stackResponse.empty()`, so there are still asteroids and the asteroid at the top of the stack has the same magnitude as the positive asteroid `a`, i.e. `stackResponse.top() = -a` and by default it is negative, then the two asteroids will both explode so they will eliminate each other `stackResponse.pop()`.
Otherwise, if the stack is not empty `!stackResponse.empty()` or the element at the top of the stack moves to the left, `stackResponse.top() < 0` then using `stackResponse.push(a)`, the value retained in `a' is added to the stack.

It is important that in each of these two substeps of the algorithm I first test if the stack is not empty and then other conditions regarding the elements of the stack to avoid later access using `top()` of an element from the top of an empty stack. Unwanted errors will appear in the code.


5. Converting the stack into an array to be returned as the final result

```cpp
    vector<int> result;
    while (!stackResponse.empty()) {
        result.push_back(stackResponse.top());
        stackResponse.pop();
    }
    reverse(result.begin(), result.end());

```

The stack we built in the previous step must be transformed into a response array that the `asteroidCollision` function can return.
For this I declare an empty array of integer type `result`.
As long as the stack still contains elements, I take the element at the top of the stack `stackResponse.top()` and using the `push_back()` method I add it to the `result` array.
After I put the current element in the `result` array, I have to delete it from the stack to have access to the next element. So I will use `pop()` method again - `stackResponse.pop()`
It is easy to understand that at the end of this process, the elements in the array will be reversed, so I will have to do a `reverse` operation to bring them into the order required by the problem.
`reverse(result.begin(), result.end());` The `reverse` function from the `<algorithm>` library is used to reverse the order of the elements in `result`.
`result.begin()` and `result.end()` define the range of array elements to be reversed. In this case, all elements in `result` are reversed, i.e. all previously added elements from the stack.

6. Return the final answer:

```cpp
    return result;
```

The elements left in the `stackResponse` after all the collisions between the asteroids were transferred to the `result` array to be reversed to be in the correct order.
With all these steps executed without error, I have prepared the final answer that can be returned by the function because it fulfills all the requirements of the problem.


In conclusion, the initial string of asteroids was processed using a stack in its processing. The algorithm ensures that each asteroid is processed in a way that minimizes the number of collisions and preserves the correct order of the remaining asteroids after all interactions. The implementation is optimized for performance and clarity, meeting the requirements of the problem in an elegant and efficient way.
